28.5.2009
1. Section 158(6) was incorporated in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 in the year 1994. Section 158(6) provides that the SHO of the Police Station shall send the Accident Information Report to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals within 30 days of recording of the FIR and a copy to the concerned Insurance Company. Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act is reproduced hereunder:-

2. Rule 150 of Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 provides that the Accident Information Report under Section 158(6) shall be in Form 54 which is reproduced hereunder:-
3. The importance of this Accident Information Report by the police is that Section 166(4) mandates the Claims Tribunal to treat the Accident Information Report as an application for compensation. However, the police was not following Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act which was brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of General Insurance Counsel vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, IV (2007) ACC 385 (SC). Vide judgment dated 9th July, 2007 the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed all the State Governments and Union Territories to instruct all concerned police officers to comply with the requirements of Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Rule 150 and Form 54 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. It was further directed that periodical checking be done by the concerned Inspector General of Police to ensure that the requirements are being complied and appropriate action be taken in cases of non-compliance. The directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said judgment are reproduced as under:-
4. On 21st April, 2009, this court issued notice to the Commissioner of Police to report whether the aforesaid directions of the Supreme Court regarding Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act are being followed. The data with respect to the compliance for the last 22 months i.e. from the date of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was also directed to be placed on record. The particulars of the periodical checking required to be done by the Commissioner of Police in terms of directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court were also directed to be placed on record. If any action has been taken against any erring officer for non-compliance of Section 158 (6), the same was also directed to be placed on record by an affidavit.
5. The Accident Information Report by the police under Section 158(6) is to be treated as an application for compensation by the claims Tribunal under Section 166(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act and, therefore, direction was also issued to the Claims Tribunals on 21st April, 2009 to place on record the report of compliance of Section 166(4) and the data for the last 22 months from the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court giving details as to how many reports have been received from the police and whether the same have been treated as application for compensation.
6. In pursuance to the above directions, an affidavit dated 18th May, 2009 was filed by the Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.) on behalf of the Commissioner of Police stating that the information in prescribed proforma was being sent to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals as per Annexure-R-B containing the details of 15,378 accidents from July, 2007 to April, 2009 in which the information in the prescribed proforma had been sent to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals.
7. On 18th May, 2009, Motor Accident Claims Tribunals also submitted their reports stating that they have not received any Accident Information Report in the prescribed proforma from the Police during the last 22 months.
8. Considering the contradictory stand taken by the Police that they have furnished the Accident Information Forms to the Tribunals during the last 22 months and the denial of the same by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals, the Delhi Police was directed to submit the report in respect of eleven Police Stations specified in the order dated 18th May, 2009 about the compliance of Section 158(6) mentioned in their affidavit dated 18th May, 2009.
9. The learned Standing Counsel for Delhi Police has today handed over a fresh affidavit of Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.) along with the affidavits of eleven SHOs. The Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.) in the affidavit dated 27th May, 2009 seeks to withdraw the previous affidavit dated 18 th May, 2009 on the ground that the Accident Information Reports have not been furnished to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals and incorrect statement had been made in the previous affidavit dated 18th May, 2009. The affidavits of the SHOs filed today also reveal that the Accident Information Reports were not being filed in most of the cases with the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals.
10. From the affidavit dated 27th May, 2009 filed by the Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.), it is clear that (i) Section 158(6) is not being complied with by the Police and; (ii) an incorrect affidavit has been filed before this Court.
11. The learned Standing Counsel for Delhi Police submits that Section 158(6) shall be strictly complied with in future and the Delhi Police is prepared to further streamline the system so that the victims of the road accident get compensation expeditiously.
12. Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act provides that the Police shall forward one copy of the Accident Information Report to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and one copy to the Insurance Company. The purpose is that immediately upon receipt of the intimation from the Police, the Insurance Company can investigate the claim and if the claim is found to be genuine, the same can be settled without the intervention of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals.
13. It is noted that this is not the first case in which this Court has shown concern on the non-compliance of Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act.

14. On 28th October, 1996, a Public Interest Litigation titled All India Lawyers Union Vs. Govt. Of NCT - C.W.P.
CW-4076/1996 was filed in this Court in which notice was issued to the Commissioner of Police on 17th October, 1997 to report about the compliance of Section 158(6)of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The relevant portion of the order dated 17 th October, 1997 is reproduced hereunder:-

Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.), Delhi Police on 18th November, 1997 in which it was stated that the SHOs were not aware of the latest amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act and the procedure which they were required to follow. It was further stated that instructions have now been issued to all the DCPs directing them to strictly comply with Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act. The instructions issued to the DCPs were filed as Annexure R-1 to the affidavit. The relevant portion of the affidavit is as under:-
16. The aforesaid report of the Police was examined by this Court on 15th December, 1997 when the Court directed the Dy. Comm. of Police (Hqrs.) to personally appear before the Court on 12th February, 1998. The relevant portion of the order dated 15th December, 1997 is reproduced hereunder:-

17. On 16th March, 1998, the Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.) appeared before this Court and assured the implementation of Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act and monitoring by the Police Headquarters. The assurance of the police was recorded by this Court and the writ petition was disposed of on 16 th March, 1998. The relevant portion of the order dated 16 th March, 1998 is reproduced hereunder:-
18. Despite the aforesaid assurance of the Police and order dated 16th March, 1998, Section 158(6) was not complied with by the Delhi Police. Two more Public Interest Litigations were filed in this Court, namely, All India Lawyers Union Vs. Union of India - C.W.P.Nos.4614/1996 and All India Lawyers Union Vs. Govt. Of National- Capital Territory Of Delhi C.W.P. Nos. 506/1999. An affidavit dated 6th September, 1999 was filed by DCP(HQ) of Delhi Police in CWP No.506/1999 in which it was stated that the reports regarding accident cases were being sent to concerned MACT Courts as early as possible in Form 54 of Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act. The relevant portion of the affidavit dated 6th September, 1999 is reproduced hereunder:-
19. Vide order dated 17th August, 2000 in CWP No.4614/1996, Delhi Police was directed to furnish information on affidavit about the number of cases where information has been sent under Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act whereupon an affidavit was filed by Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.) of Delhi Police on 17th October, 2000 in which it was stated as under:-
20. Vide order dated 19th October, 2000 in CWP No.4614/1996, the Division Bench of this Court directed the District Judge to collect the information from the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals as to the number of cases in which such information had been received and the action taken. The relevant portion of the order dated 19th October, 2000 is reproduced hereunder:-
21. In pursuance to the aforesaid order, the report was submitted by the Tribunals that the police was only sending the copies of the FIRs and no reports under Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act in Form 54 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1999 had ever been sent by the Police Stations.

22. Both the aforesaid writ petitions were disposed of by this Court by a common order dated 12th April, 2001 observing that the information furnished was not in prescribed form and usually a copy of the FIR was furnished which does not meet the requirement of law. It was directed that the concerned offices should strictly comply with the requirements as stipulated in statutory provisions. The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced hereunder:-

23. From the aforesaid orders, it is clear that Section 158(6) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has not been implemented by Delhi Police during the last about 15 years despite two orders of this Court and one by the Apex Court. Time and again incorrect affidavits have been filed by Delhi Police before this Court stating that Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act was being strictly complied with and the Accident Information Reports were being sent to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals in prescribed Form
54. The affidavit dated 18th May, 2009 also contains incorrect statement regarding the filing of the Accident Information Reports in prescribed form during July, 2007 to April, 2009. There is clear non-compliance of the orders dated 16th March, 1998 as well as 12th April, 2001 passed by this Court.

24. Considering the non-compliance of the orders dated 16th March, 1998 and 12th April, 2001 of this Court as well as the filing of affidavit dated 18th May, 2009 containing incorrect statements, show cause notice is issued initially to Dy.

25. This case cannot be closed on the mere apology and assurance of the Police that they shall now implement the Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. This Court twice accepted the assurance given by the Police and closed the cases in 1998 and 2001. The implementation of Section 158(6) shall be monitored by this Court for some time. Let the Police file a monthly report of the compliance of Section 158(6) with this Court.

The Tribunals are directed to maintain separate Institution Register for institution of the Accident Information Reports under Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the cognizance of the Reports be taken on judicial side as in the case of Final Reports under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the notice be issued to all concerned.

27. The learned Standing Counsel for Delhi Police submits that the Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.) regrets the lapse of non-implementation of Section 158(6) and non-compliance of the orders of this Court.
