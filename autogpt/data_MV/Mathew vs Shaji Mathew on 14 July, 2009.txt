Kerala High Court
Mathew vs Shaji Mathew on 14 July, 2009
K.M.Joseph, J.
These two appeals are connected and they are disposed of by this common judgment. M.A.C.A.1242 of 2008 is filed by the Ist respondent in O.P.(MV) No.1316/2004 which is a petition filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act by the appellant in M.A.C.A No.1905/2008. The vehicle driven by the appellant in MACA No.1242/2008 was involved in an accident resulting in injuries being caused to his wife namely, the appellant in MACA No.1905/2008. The Tribunal has awarded a total compensation of Rs.86,550/- with interest at 8.5 percent from the date of application till satisfaction. We shall refer to the appellant in MACA No.1242/2008 as the owner of the vehicle and the appellant in MACA No.1905/2008 as the claimant.
2. The Tribunal has exonerated the 2nd respondent insurance company from liability. The owner has filed the appeal challenging the exoneration of the insurance company. The claimant has preferred the appeal seeking enhancement of the compensation awarded.
3. We heard learned counsel appearing for the owner, the claimant and the insurance company. We will take up the appeal filed by the owner. The question posed for our consideration and decision is whether the Tribunal was justified in exonerating the insurance company from liability to reimburse the amount payable by the owner. This is a case of a private car package. We will straight away extract the relevant terms of the policy. The relevant clauses under Section II read as follows:

In the Schedule the limits of the liability is stated as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEDULE OF PREMIUM (IN RS.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A: OD- BASIC 4,558,50 B:T.P.=BASIC 500.00 NCB 24% 1,139.63 COMPULSORY PA TO OWNER-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. There is also a clause which deals with personal accident cover for the owner-driver with which we may not be concerned. We notice that a Division Bench of this Court had occasion to consider a clause which though not identical bears some similarity to the clause which falls for our consideration reported in New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Hydrose (2008 (3) KLT 778). The Court was considering a "B" policy. The Court inter alia held as follows:
She would therefore contend that the addition of this clause in the policy which is issued after 2001 makes all the difference in regard to the question of liability to be shouldered by the insurance company. In other words, she submits that there is no liability to the insurance company to reimburse the owner the amount which he has been found liable to pay by the Tribunal. Learned counsel for the insurance company would also contend that no premium is paid to cover the liability.
7. Learned counsel for the owner would point out that there are no words limiting the liability. An occupant in the vehicle provided the occupant is not for hire or reward is covered by the policy. She would further contend that as far as employees is concerned the owner has paid Rs.25 extra to cover an employee and in this case as the claimant is none other than the wife of the owner who was carried as a gratuitous passenger in the private car and the insurance company is liable. We are of the view that there is merit in the contention of the owner that the Tribunal should not have exonerated the insurance company from liability. The reasoning of the Tribunal reads as follows:

8. We will have to first consider as to what has been laid down by the Full Bench decision in Mathew Joseph vs. Janaki {2007 (1) KLT 747 (F.B)}. The Full Bench inter alia held as follows:
However, it is open to the parties to enter into contract by which the insurance company undertakes liability on an extended basis. In other words, it is open to the insurance company to assume liability covering such number of persons in excess of what it is liable to cover under the Act only policy. The terms of Section II(1) has in our view the following result-- It starts with the limiting of liability with reference to the limits of liability laid down in the Schedule. We had already indicated the limits of liability. The limits of liability is related and conditioned only by the limits under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Under Section II (i) in respect of any one accident it is as per Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The question arises is as to what is the effect of reference of Motor Vehicles Act,1988. Sub-section 1 of Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 reads as follows:
Sub-section 2 of Section 147 reads as follows:

11. Having thus dealt with the limits of liability of the insurance company, the further question which is before us is whether a person like the claimant in this case who was an occupant carried in the vehicle and where there is no dispute that she was carried not for hire or reward is covered by the terms of policy? On the one hand, it is pointed out by the learned counsel for the insurance company that the presence of the words but except so far as it is necessary to meet the requirements of Motor Vehicles Act, will detract from the liability of the insurance company. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the owner contended that the liability which is spoken of in the earlier part of Section II (1) is not any way diluted. It is true that the word 'but' does not have a capital 'B' and when one reads the provision one may at first blush get the impression that the words but except so far as it is necessary to meet the requirements of Motor Vehicles Act, will qualify or limit the word death of or injury to gratuitous occupants carried in the vehicle also. We asked the learned counsel for the owner that if these words are read as meaning that it is part of the same sentence and then it is meant to qualify the earlier part which we have referred what would be the effect. Learned counsel for the insurance company was not in a position to offer a meaningful interpretation to the words of the clause. In other words, an interpretation would have to be evolved by us which would make the words 'occupants carried in the vehicle (provided such occupants are not carried for hire or reward) meaningful. Now, let us examine whether it is possible for us to pour meaning into the clause without doing violence to the express words occupants carried in the vehicle (provided such occupants are not carried for hire or reward). We are of the view that the words but except so far as it is necessary to meet the requirements of Motor Vehicles Act, is relatable to abridging the liability of the insurance company in respect of a death or injury caused to a person who was travelling in the vehicle in the course of the employment of such person by the insured. In other words, the insurance company wanted to make it clear that it was not undertaking the liability in respect of a death or injury of a person in the course of employment of such person by the insured except so far as it is necessary to meet the requirements of Motor Vehicles Act. The question then arises is what is the meaning of the word to meet the requirements of Motor Vehicles Act. Proviso to Section 147 (1) reads as follows:

13. Smt.P.A.Reziya, the learned counsel for the insurance company refer to two decisions of the Apex Court. In the decision reported in New India Assurance Co.Lts. vs. Jaya (2002 (1) KLT 596) the Apex Court had to deal with the question of the liability incurred by the insurance company and the question posed was whether the liability is unlimited or higher than the statutory liability. Therein the Court undertook an exhaustive survey of the case law. It referred in particular the decision of the Apex Court in Amrit Lal Sood and Another v. Kaushalya Devi Thapar and Others (1998 (3) SCC 744). Therein the clause which was considered by the Apex Court is as follows:

15. Learned counsel for the insurance company then referred us to the judgment of the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.3335/2009. Therein the Apex Court, no doubt, was considering a clause similar to the clause which we are called upon to decide in this case. The Apex Court after reference to New India Assurance Co.Ltd. V.Asha Rani { (2003) 2 SCC 223}, and and Amrit Lal's case which we have referred to held that the matter must be considered by a Larger Bench. Paragraph 26 of the judgment reads as follows:
v. Hydrose (2008 (3) KLT778) the company has undertaken liability in respect of a gratuitous passenger. Going by the Schedule of premium we find that basic is shown as Rs.500/-. According to the owner it would cover the liability which is referred to us in Section II (1). Thereafter, Rs.100 is collected towards compulsory PA to owner-driver.
17. Going by the terms of the policy clearly the insurance company has undertaken the liability. In such circumstances, we are of the view that, the appeal filed by the owner is only to be allowed and we do so. The award is modified and it is ordered that the 2nd respondent in the claim petition will be liable to pay the amount ordered to be paid. We set aside the exoneration of the 2nd respondent and order that the 2nd respondent in the claim petition is also liable to pay the amount.
18. As far as the appeal filed by the claimant is concerned, learned counsel for the appellant essentially raised three points before us. Firstly, the counsel would contend that the Tribunal has erred in fixing the amount of loss of earning as Rs.15,000/- only. According to him, there was evidence warranting higher income Secondly, he would contend that the Tribunal has erred in fixing the multiplier at 13 instead of 15. He also submits that the appellant was in hospital for 11 days and the Tribunal awarded only Rs.450/- towards bystander expenses.
19. As far as the question of income is concerned the reasoning of the Tribunal is that the appellant produced two certificates. Discussion of the Tribunal in para 13 of the award reads as under.
We do not see any reason to disturb the reasoning of the Tribunal or the finding rendered on the said basis. As far as the question of multiplier is concerned, the multiplier adopted is 13. According to the counsel for the appellant the appellant was below 45 years. The Tribunal held that there is no evidence to prove her age and treated her age as above 45 years and below 50 years.
21. In the first place we must realise that we must not overlook the fact that the appellant is working as a teacher and the Tribunal, has, in fact, awarded disability compensation of Rs.46,800/ on the basis of disability arrived at 10%. . The appellant is relying on the discharge certificate and wound certificate. We are not satisfied that the appellant has made out a case for adopting a higher multiplier. The appellant has been awarded Rs.450/- towards bystander expenses. Having regard to the total sum which is awarded we feel that there is no need to enhance the compensation. We find that the compensation awarded is just. In view of the above discussion, the appeal filed by the claimant will stand dismissed.
