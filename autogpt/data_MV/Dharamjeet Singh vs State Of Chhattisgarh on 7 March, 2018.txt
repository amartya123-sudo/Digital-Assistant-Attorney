Chattisgarh High Court
Dharamjeet Singh vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 7 March, 2018
(a) a public servant on duty,
(b) a person who has been permitted by the Chief Wild Life Warden or the authorised officer to reside within the limits of the sanctuary,
(c) a person who has any right over immovable property within the limits of the sanctuary,
(d) a person passing through the sanctuary along a public highway, and
(e) the dependents of the person referred to in clause (a), clause (b) or clause (c), shall enter or reside in the sanctuary, except under and in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted under section 28.
(2) Every person shall, so long as he resides in the sanctuary, be bound--
7. A focused glance of the aforesaid provision would show that restriction of entry in the sanctuary is permissible by virtue of Section 27(1)(b) of the Act of 1972 and restriction can be imposed by the Chief Wild Life Warden. By virtue of Section 27(1)
(d) of the Act of 1972, a person is within his right to pass through the sanctuary along a public highway.
8. A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in the matter of In Re Travancore Devaswom Board1 speaking through T.B. Radhakrishnan, J, as then His Lordship was (presently the Chief Justice of this Court), while dealing with a declared sanctuary i.e. Periyar Tiger Reserve under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 has held that the sanctuary declared in terms of the provisions of the Act of 1972 is a protected area and the prime purpose for declaration of an area as sanctuary is for the purpose of protecting, propagating and developing wild life or its environment. While dealing with Section 27(1)(d) of the Act of 1972 it has been held that if there is a public highway through a sanctuary, it can be used only for the restricted purpose of a highway and that movement be not utilised for further intrusion into the sanctuary and observed as under: -
The aforesaid observation made by the Division Bench squarely applies to the facts of the present case.
9. Likewise, Section 28 of the Act of 1972 provides for grant of permit which states as under: -
10. Under Section 28 of the Act of 1972, the Chief Wild Life Warden is competent to impose restriction on entry of public in a sanctuary once it is declared as such under Section 35 of the Act of 1972. Under Section 28(2) of the Act of 1972, the Chief Wild Life Warden is authorised to permit to enter or reside in a sanctuary subject to such conditions and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed. Thus, the Chief Wild Life Warden is conferred with the power to permit entry into area declared as a National Park subject to such conditions and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed. In other words, when a declaration is made under Section 35 of the Act of 1972 converting a particular area as a National Park, the authority is competent to impose certain conditions, however, no provision is brought to my notice prohibiting entry into the National Park, as such, there is no provision completely prohibiting W.P.(C)No.268/2017 entry into the National Park or sanctuary area. By virtue of Section 27(1)(d) of the Act of 1972, a person is entitled to pass through the sanctuary along a public highway.
11. The fact remains that no such power has been conferred either under Section 27 or Section 28 of the Act of 1972 to impose restriction on entry into a sanctuary or a National Park along a public highway, as the case may be, to the Collector-cum- District Magistrate and even otherwise, no such power is said to have been exercised by the District Magistrate under Section 27 or Section 28 of the Act of 1972. Therefore, the impugned order of prohibition cannot be said to have been passed by the Collector-cum-District Magistrate either under Section 27 or Section 28(2) of the Act of 1972. There is no other provision in the Act of 1972 empowering the Collector- cum-District Magistrate to prohibit the citizens from using a public highway passing through the ATR, as the said route Kota-Achanakmar-Kevchi is covered by State Highway-8.
12. This would lead me to the issue as to whether the learned Collector-cum-District Magistrate can exercise the power to prohibit the entry into the said public highway i.e. Kota-Achanakmar-Kevchi route by restriction provided under Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 215 of the Chhattisgarh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1994. At this stage, it would be appropriate to notice Article 19(1)d) of the Constitution of India which provides as under: -
14. The reasonableness of restriction has to be determined in an objective manner and from stand point of the interest of general public. While considering the aspect of validity of restriction and judging reasonableness of law, it is necessary to consider surrounding circumstances and it is also necessary to find out whether it is for furthering the social interest.
15. The Supreme Court in the matter of State of Himachal Pradesh and another v.
Umed Ram Sharma and others2 has held as under: -
16. At this stage, now, it is appropriate to notice Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which gives power to the Collector to prohibit or restrict entry of motor vehicles on road or roads in the interest of public at large, and Rule 215 of the Chhattisgarh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1994, which read as follows: -
17. A focused glance of the aforesaid provisions would show that (i) the State Government or any authority authorised in this behalf; (ii) on being satisfied that it is necessary in the interest of public safety or convenience, or because of the nature of any road or bridge; (iii) may by notification in the Official Gazette, prohibit or restrict, subject to such exceptions and conditions as may be specified in the notification, the driving of motor vehicles or of any specified class or description of motor vehicles or the use of trailers either generally in a specified area or on a specified road, impose any such prohibition or restriction. Proviso to Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides that for prohibition or restriction for more than one month, notification in the Official Gazette shall not be necessary.
18. Thus, for prohibition of use of road or bridge for more than one month, issuance of notification in the Official Gazette is a statutory requirement that it is necessary in the interest of public safety or convenience, or because of the nature of any road or bridge, such a prohibition or restriction to any specified class or description of motor vehicles is necessary. Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides that such a notification has to be published in the Official Gazette if the prohibition or W.P.(C)No.268/2017 restriction is for more than one month.
19. It is the basic principle of law long settled, that, if the manner of doing a particular act is prescribed under any statute, the act must be done in that manner or not at all. The origin of this rule is traceable to the decision in the matter of Taylor v. Taylor3, which was followed by Lord Roche in the matter of Nazir Ahmed v. King Emperor4, who stated as under: -
"Where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all."
20. Similar is the proposition laid down in the matter of State of U.P. v. Singhara Singh and others5 in which the Supreme Court has clearly held that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all and that the other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden.
21. A power under a statute has to be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the statute and in no other manner. (See J.N. Ganatra v. Morvi Municipality, Morvi 6 and Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai v. Anjum M.H. Ghaswala and others7.)
22. Thus, publication of notification in the Official Gazette is a sine qua non / mandatory for valid restriction / prohibition of the use of motor vehicles under Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, if restriction / prohibition is for more than one month.
23. In the matter of New Motor Transport Company, Durg v. Regional Transport Authority, Raipur and others8, a Division Bench of the High Court of Nagpur dealing with Section 74 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 which is pari materia provision to Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, has held that the District Magistrate is 3 (1876) 1 Ch D 426 4 AIR 1936 PC 253 (2) 5 AIR 1964 SC 358 6 (1996) 9 SCC 495 7 (2002) 1 SCC 633 8 AIR 1952 Nag 111 W.P.(C)No.268/2017 empowered to prohibit or restrict in the interests of public safety, or convenience, the driving of motor vehicles or any specified class of motor vehicles or the use of trailers, either generally in a specified area or on a specified road. The prohibition or restricting may no doubt be subject to exceptions and conditions but the exceptions and conditions cannot however be arbitrary. As the power to restrict or prohibit is conferred in the interest of public safety or convenience or because of the nature of any road or bridge, the exceptions and conditions subject to which the power of prohibition or restriction may be exercised must themselves proceed on no other considerations except those necessitating the prohibition or restricting under the section. The Division Bench further held that the District Magistrate has to prescribe the exceptions and conditions in general way and leave the control of transport vehicles by permits to the transport authorities functioning under the Act and observed as under: -
24. Thus, the Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court has clearly held that the control of transport vehicles can only be done by transport authorities functioning under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and the District Magistrate can only prescribe the exceptions and conditions in general way.
25. In the matter of Ram Sahai Varma v. State of Madhya Pradesh and another 9, again a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dealing with Section 74 of 9 AIR 1989 MP 334 W.P.(C)No.268/2017 the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 has clearly held that the power and jurisdiction under Section 74 of the said Act of 1939 must be exercised for safety or convenience of the public generally. The power envisaged under Section 74 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 is to be exercised judiciously and reasonably. Minimum and reasonable restrictions matching the avowed objective can only stand the constitutional cavil of Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of movement to citizens. The Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court observed as under: -
26. Reverting to the factual matrix of the present case after having examined the legal statutory provisions in this regard and the principles of law flowing from the aforesaid judgments (supra), it is quite vivid that under Section 27(1)(d) of the Act of 1972, a person is entitled to pass through a sanctuary along a public highway and order of restriction can only be passed under Section 28(2) of the Act of 1972 by the competent authority and no such power has been conferred to any authority to prohibit completely in the State Highway, the movement of public / transport vehicles carrying citizens and therefore the order of total prohibition of movement of vehicles of citizens on Kota-Achanakmar-Kevchi route (State Highway-8) by the learned Collector-cum-District Magistrate is without jurisdiction and without authority of law. Apart from this, under Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 215 of the Chhattisgarh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1994, the Collector-cum-District Magistrate W.P.(C)No.268/2017 is empowered only if on satisfaction being recorded that in the interest of public safety or convenience, or because of the nature of any road or bridge, such a prohibition or restriction is necessary, but in the instant case, no such reasons have been assigned by the learned District Magistrate holding that in the interest of public safety or looking to nature of road, such a prohibition is necessary. In the instant case, the order has been passed on the recommendation of a Local Advisory Committee and taking in view the application submitted by the Deputy Director, ATR which is not a sine qua non for exercising power under Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and which is neither in the interest of public safety or convenience nor because of the nature of any road or bridge. Apart from this, second part of Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has not been complied with i.e. publication of notification in the Official Gazette which is mandatory in nature for restricting use of road for more than one month and once the mandatory provision has been complied with in its breach and notification issued under Section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has not been published in the Official Gazette, the action taken becomes illegal and is liable to be quashed. Thus, in my considered opinion, the Collector-cum-District Magistrate has no jurisdiction to make sweeping prohibition on the usage of public vehicles on road Kota-Achanakmar-Kevchi (State Highway-8) by the citizens including the petitioners which is violative of the petitioners' right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution of India.
27. As a fallout and consequence of aforesaid discussion, the impugned order passed by the Collector-cum-District Magistrate is quashed. The Collector-cum-District Magistrate is directed to make it open for all and make the said route usable and roadworthy for citizens and it will be used only for restricted purpose of highway and it cannot in any manner be utilised for further intrusion into the sanctuary or in any manner affecting faunal, floral and natural significance of the said area. However, the competent authority is at liberty to proceed in accordance with law.
W.P.(C)No.268/2017
