Author: Tarun Kumar Gupta
IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA CIVIL REVISIONAL JURISDICTION Present: The Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tarun Kumar Gupta C. O. No.2380 of 2007 Sri Bhaben Saha Versus Smt. Anjali Saha and Ors.
C. O. No.2404 of 2007 Miss Latika Saha and Ors.
Versus Smt. Anjali Saha and Ors.

These two revisional applications arose out of two different orders passed in the same case being M. A. C. Case No. 258 of 2006 filed under Section 163 (A) of the Motor Vehicles Act. However, these two civil revisions are taken up for disposal by a common order as a common question of law is involved in both the matters.
On account of death of victim Dibakar Saha in a motor vehicle accident, his wife Anjali Saha (O. P. No.1 in both these cases) filed an application for compensation under Section 163 A Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 against owner and insurer of the offending motor vehicle. It was registered as M.A.C. Case No.258 of 2006 in the District Judge's Court at Malda.
Petitioner of C.O. No.2380 of 2007 namely Bhaben Saha filed a petition in the Claims Tribunal under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Code praying to be added as co-petitioner on the ground that he was father of deceased Dibakar Saha and that he was a legal heir of Dibakar.
The original petitioner wife Anjali Saha filed a written objection denying the claim of Bhaben Saha as he was a class-II heir of deceased Dibakar Saha and that petitioner wife Anjali Saha was class-I heir of deceased.
After contested hearing learned District Judge, Malda being the Judge of the Tribunal dismissed said petition filed by father Bhaben Saha on the ground that he being a class-II heir of the deceased under Hindu Succession Act, 1956 cannot be added as a co-petitioner in this claim case where wife being class -I heir was claiming compensation vide Order No.7 dated 21st of April, 2007.
Being aggrieved with said order dated 21st April, 2007 this revisional application being C.O. No.2380 of 2007 was filed.
On 16.05.2007 Miss Latika Saha and others filed a similar petition in the same case praying to be added as co-petitioners under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. According to them, they were brothers and sisters of victim Dibakar Saha and that they were dependent on Dibakar Saha as their father Bhaben Saha did not look after them after his second marriage. Learned District Judge being the Judge of the Accident Tribunal dismissed said petition on the same ground namely petitioners cannot be permitted under Hindu Succession Act, 1956 to be added as co-petitioners as they were class-II heirs and the claim case was filed by the wife of the deceased being class-I heir.
Being aggrieved by said Order dated 7th June, 2007 this revisional application being C.O. No.2404 of 2007 was filed.
The only point for consideration is whether learned Judge of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal caused miscarriage of justice by rejecting the petitions filed by father and brothers and sisters under Order 1 Rule 10 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code, by the orders impugned holding that class-II heirs cannot be permitted to be co-petitioners in a claim case under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 filed by one class -I heir.

Sri Krishanu Banik, learned advocate appearing for the petitioners in both these cases, has submitted that learned Judge of the Tribunal ought to have considered that the expression "legal heirs" in Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 should be given wider meaning and that it should not have been confined only to wife / spouse, children of the deceased and that the impugned order was bad in law and should be set aside by this Court.
In this connection, he has referred a case law reported in AIR 1987 SC page 1690 (Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation v. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai and another).
Mr. Saidur Rahaman, learned advocate, has appeared for O. P. No.1 Anjali Saha in both the cases. He has submitted that the referred case law was relating to the interpretation of the term "legal representatives" as appearing in Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and not relating to the interpretation of the term "legal heirs" as appearing in Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and hence aforesaid case law had no application in these cases.
Admittedly, the term "legal representatives" as well as the term "legal heirs" has not been defined in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. However, the term "legal representatives" is much wider than the term "legal heirs". "Legal heirs" means persons to whom law would give deceased's property if deceased dies intestate. It is usually governed by the personal law of the deceased.

The term "legal representative" in its broad sense means one who stands in place of, and represents the interest of, another. Examples include the executor or administrator of an estate and a Court appointed guardian of a minor or incompetent person.
Under sub-Section 11 of Section (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 "legal representative" means a person who will represent the estate of the deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased, and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character, the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued.
The term "legal representative" as used in Section 110-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (which corresponds to Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988) came up for consideration before Hon'ble Apex Court in the above referred case of Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation, Ahmedabad (ibid). The Hon'ble Apex Court held as follows:-
"Every legal representative who suffers on account of the death of a person due to a motor vehicle accident should have a remedy for realization of compensation and that is provided by Ss. 110-A to 110-F. These provisions are in consonance with the principles of law of torts that every injury must have a remedy. It is for the Motor Vehicles Accidents Tribunal to determine the compensation which appears to it to be just as provided in S.110-B and to specify the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid. The determination of the compensation payable and its apportionment as required by S.110-B amongst the legal representatives for whose benefit an application may be filed under S.110-A have to be done in accordance with well-known principles of law. It is to be remembered that in an Indian family brothers, sisters and brothers' children and sometimes foster children live together and they are dependent upon the bread-winner of the family and if the bread-winner is killed on account of a motor vehicle accident, there is no justification to deny them compensation relying upon the provisions of the Fatal Accidents act, 1855 which has been substantially modified by the provisions contained in the Motor Vehicles Act in relation to cases arising out of motor vehicles accidents."
There is no denial that on the basis of the ratio of said Supreme Court judgment passed in the case of Gujarat Road Transport Corporation, Ahmedabad (ibid) various judgments of various High Courts were passed to include dependent brothers and sisters and other relatives within ambit of "legal representatives" for getting compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
In this connection, it is pertinent to note that all those judgments including the epic judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court as referred above were relating to the interpretation of the term "legal representatives" as appearing in Section 110-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 which corresponds to Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. However, in the present case claim application was filed by the wife of the deceased under Section 163-A of the Act of 1988.
Section 163-A of the Act of 1988 is reproduced below:-
"(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force or instrument having the force of law, the owner of the motor vehicle or the authorized insurer shall be liable to pay in the case of death or permanent disablement due to accident arising out of the use of motor vehicle, compensation, as indicated in the Second Schedule, to the legal heirs or the victim, as the case may be.

Explanation. - For the purposes of this sub-section, "permanent disability" shall have the same meaning and extent as in the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923).
(2) in any claim for compensation under sub-section (1), the claimant shall not be required to plead or establish that the death or permanent disablement in respect of which the claim has been made was due to any wrongful act or neglect or default of the owner of the vehicle or vehicles concerned or of any other person.
(3) the Central Government may, keeping in view the cost of living by notification in the Official Gazette, from time to time amend the Second Schedule."
From the plain reading of Section 163-A it appears that said special provisions as to payment of compensation on structural formula basis, either to the victim in case of sustaining permanent disability, or to the legal heirs of the deceased, were brought on the statute book even when no wrongful act or neglect was pleaded against the owner of the vehicle. This is a new provision which was inserted in 1994 through amendment by Act 54 of 1994 and came into force with effect from 14th of November, 1994. It is thus clear that even if the owner of the motor vehicle had no tortious liability towards the victim still he is liable to pay compensation to the victim in case of permanent disability or to the legal heirs of the deceased victim, on account of any accident caused by his motor vehicle. So, Section 163-A of the Act of 1988 is standing on a separate footing from Section 166 of said Act of 1988 (corresponding to Section 110-A of the earlier Act of 1939). An action could have been brought under Section 166 Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 (corresponding to Section 110-A of the earlier Act, 1939) only if negligence and / or tortious liability on the part of the owner of the vehicle can be established. As such, the scope and / or ambit of Section 166 Motor Vehicles Act, (corresponding to Section 110-A of the earlier Act of 1939) was quite different from that of Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act.
In this connection, it is also pertinent to note that the term "legal heirs" was used in Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 whereas the term "legal representatives" was used in Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (corresponding to Section 110-A of the earlier Act of 1939). When legislators used two different terms in the same statute under two separate provisions both provided for awarding compensation but under different circumstances, then it has to be accepted that legislators used those different terms purposely and knowingly to make and create differentiation. As such, the above referred case law of Hon'ble Apex Court has no application in the matter of defining the term "legal heirs" appearing under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

I have already stated that succession to the estate of a deceased is governed by his personal law. In the present case the deceased Dibakar Saha was a Hindu.
Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 lays down general rules of succession in case of males as follows:

"The property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the provisions of this Chapter -


Section 9 of said Act of 1956 deals with order of succession among heirs in the Schedule.

Section 9 of said Act stands as follows:-
"Among the heirs specified in the Schedule, those in class I shall take simultaneously and to the exclusion of all other heirs; those in the first entry in class II shall be preferred to those in the second entry; those in the second entry shall be preferred to those in the third entry; and so on in succession."
On conjoint reading of section 8 and Section 9 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 it is apparent that in case of a male Hindu dying intestate his property / estate will devolve upon his class I heirs to the exclusion of all other heirs.
Admittedly, petitioner Anjali Saha of the claim case was widow of the victim and was the sole class I heir. It is also an admitted fact that father, brothers and sisters who are petitioners of these two revisional applications are class II heirs. As such, learned Judge of the Claims Tribunal did not commit any illegality or irregularity by rejecting the claims of the present petitioners being class II heirs of the victim when his wife Anjali Saha being the sole class I heir instituted the claim case under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
As a result, both the revisional applications stand dismissed on contest. I pass no order as to costs.

Urgent xerox certified copy of this judgment be supplied to the learned Counsels of the party / parties, if applied for.
