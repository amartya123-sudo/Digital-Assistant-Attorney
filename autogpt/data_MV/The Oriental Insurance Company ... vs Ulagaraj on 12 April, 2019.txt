Madras High Court
The Oriental Insurance Company ... vs Ulagaraj on 12 April, 2019
There is no representation on behalf of the first to fifth respondents/claimants even though the name of the counsel Mr.M.Kavikannan has been printed in the cause list. He has filed vakalat for the first to fifth respondents. This case was listed twice earlier and adjourned so that the counsel for the first to fifth respondents can appear and defend the impugned Judgment and Decree and assist the Court. However, it appears that the counsel engaged for them is not interested to protect the interest of his clients despite the case appearing twice in the list. After hearing the learned counsel for appellant insurance company it was finally reserved for passing orders.

2. The Insurance Company is the appellant in this appeal. It is aggrieved by the impugned Judgment and Decree dated 12.04.2019 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Special Subordinate Judge), Tirupattur in M.C.O.P.No.133 of 2015.
3. By the impugned Judgment and Decree, the Tribunal has awarded an amount of Rs.17,47,500/- together with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of claim petition till the date of deposit to the first to fifth respondents even though they have claimed for Rs.10,00,000/-

4. The first to fifth respondents were the claimants before the Tribunal in M.C.O.P.No.133 of 2015. They had filed a claim petition for compensation for the death of their wife and mother Poongodi who died in an accident tragically on 07.03.2014. She was riding as a pillion rider on a motor cycle (TVS-XL Super) bearing Registration No.TN-23-
BL-4249 driven by the fourth respondent who is her daughter. The said motor cycle was hit by an uninsured motor cycle (Hero Honda) bearing ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 3 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 Registration No.TN-23-BZ-1801. Therefore, the claim petition was filed against only against the appellant, the insurer of the motor cycle (TVS-XL Super) bearing Registration No.TN-23-BL-4249.
5. The case of the appellant Insurance Company is that the Tribunal having concluded that the owner and the rider of the Hero Honda Motorcycle bearing Registration No.TN-23-BZ-1801 was rash and negligent and had caused the accident, ought not to have awarded compensation to be paid by the appellant insurer of the TVS-XL Super Motorcycle bearing Registration No.TN-23-BL-4249, merely because the owner the appellant had extended a comprehensive insurance cover for the owner of the aforesaid moped.
6. The Tribunal has allowed the claim petition with the following observations:-

7. The Tribunal has referred to the following passages from the above decision:-
8. The learned counsel for the appellant Insurance Company submits that the owner of the TVS-XL Super Motorcycle bearing Registration No.TN-23-BL-4249 had also independently filed M.C.O.P.No.134 of 2015 which was disposed by the Tribunal. It is ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 7 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 submitted that the Tribunal ought to have dismissed the claim of first to fifth respondents/claimants.
9. The learned counsel for the appellant Insurance Company placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Minu B.Mehta Vs Balkrishna Ramchandra Nayan, 1977 (2) SCC 441. He submitted that in the said decision, it has been held that to fasten the liability on the insurer, the claimant has to prove negligence of the owner of the insured vehicle The said order was rendered in the context of Section 95 and 110E of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939.

12. The learned counsel for the appellant Insurance Company has further placed reliance on the following decisions:-
13. As a concession, the learned counsel for the appellant Insurance Company has offered a concession with a humanitarian view in mind. He submits that the appellant Insurance Company was willing to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 since the policy issued was a comprehensive policy.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 9 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019
14. I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant and the case laws submitted before this Court.
15. The facts are not in dispute. The accident took place on 07.03.2014 when the deceased Poongodi travelled on a TVS-XL Super moped bearing registration No.TN-23-BL-4249 as a pillion rider. It was hit by an uninsured Hero Honda Motorcycle bearing registration No.TN-
23-BZ-1801.
16. The accident resulted in an injury to the rider of the moped Vinitha. The insured rider is the daughter of the deceased who is the fourth respondent herein. She had also independently filed M.C.O.P.No.134 of 2015. The said M.C.O.P. was partly allowed.
17. M.C.O.P.No.133 of 2015 was filed by all the legal representatives of the deceased Poongodi. It was allowed by the Tribunal by its impugned judgment and decree dated 12.04.2019.

19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Minu B. Mehta and Others Vs. Balkrishna Ramchandra Nayan and Others, (1977) 2 SCC 441 :
AIR 1977 SC 1248 had rendered its decision in the context of Sections 95 and 110(e) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Section 95 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 is pari materia with Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. For a easy comparison, both Sections 95 and 110(e) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 are reproduced below:-
Compensation Act, 1923, in Explanation. —For the removal of ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 12 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 respect of the death of, or doubts, it is hereby declared that the bodily injury to, any such death of or bodily injury to any person employee- or damage to any property of a third

20. Similarly, Section 92A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 is pari materia with Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Both provisions read as under:-
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 14 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 permanent disablement of any person (1) Notwithstanding has resulted from an accident arising anything contained in this out of the use of a motor vehicle or Act or in any other law for motor vehicles, the owner of the the time being in force or vehicle shall, or, as the case may be, instrument having the force the owners of the vehicles shall, jointly of law, the owner of the and severally, be liable to pay motor vehicle or the compensation in respect of such death authorised insurer shall be or disablement in accordance with the liable to pay in the case of provisions of this section. death or permanent (2) The amount of compensation which disablement due to accident shall be payable under sub-section (1) arising out of the use of in respect of the death of any person motor vehicle, shall be a fixed sum of fifteen thousand compensation, as indicated rupees and the amount of in the Second Schedule, to compensation payable under that sub- the legal heirs or the victim, section in respect of the permanent as the case may be. disablement of any person shall be a (2) In any claim for fixed sum of seven thousand five compensation under sub- hundred rupees. section (1), the claimant (3) In any claim for compensation shall not be required to under sub-section (1), the claimant plead or establish that the shall not be required to plead and death or permanent establish that the death or permanent disablement in respect of disablement in respect of which the which the claim has been claim has been made was due to any made was due to any wrongful act, neglect or default of the wrongful act or neglect or owner or owners of the vehicle or default of the owner of the vehicles concerned or of any other vehicle or vehicles person. concerned or of any other (4) A claim for compensation under person. sub-section (1) shall not be defeated by (3) The Central Government reason of any wrongful act, neglect or may, keeping in view the default of the person in respect of cost of living by notification whose death or permanent disablement in the Official Gazette, from the claim has been made nor shall the time to time amend the quantum of compensation recoverable Second Schedule. in respect of such death or permanent disablement be reduced on the basis of the share of such person in the ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 15 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 responsibility for such death or permanent disablement.”
21. Similarly, Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is similar to Section 110A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 of the Act which are reproduced below:-
by the person injured or all or Provided that where all the legal any of the legal representatives representatives of the deceased of the deceased, as the case may have not joined in any such be: application for compensation, the application shall be made on Provided that where all the behalf of or for the benefit of all ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 16 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 legal representatives of the the legal representatives of the deceased have not joined in any deceased and the legal such application for representatives who have not so compensation, the application joined, shall be impleaded as shall be made on behalf of or respondents to the application. for the benefit of all the legal (2) Every application under representatives of the deceased sub-section (1) shall be made, at and the legal representatives the option of the claimant, either to who have not so joined, shall be the Claims Tribunal having impleaded as respondents to the jurisdiction over the area in which application. the accident occurred, or to the Claims Tribunal within the local (2) Every application under sub- limits of whose jurisdiction the section (1) shall be made to the claimant resides or carries on Claims Tribunal having business or within the local limits jurisdiction over the area in of whose jurisdiction the defendant which the accident occurred, resides, and shall be in such form and shall be in such form and and contain such particulars as shall contain such particular as may be prescribed: Provided that may be prescribed: where no claim for compensation under section 140 is made in such application, the application shall contain a separate statement to that effect immediately before the signature of the applicant.
22. Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 states that an application for compensation arising out of an accident specified in Sub-
Section 1 to Section 166 of the Act may be made: -
23. As per the proviso, where all the “legal representatives” of the deceased have not joined in any such application for compensation, the application shall be made on behalf of or for the benefit of all the “legal representatives” of the deceased and the legal representatives who have not so joined, shall be impleaded as respondents to the application.
24. The claims Tribunal is required to adjudicate claims for compensation under Section 165 of the Act in respect of accidents involving _
(a) death; or
(b) bodily injury to a person arising out use of motor vehicle; or
(c) damage to any body.
25. On the other hand, Section 163(A) of the Act is an exception to Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Under the scheme of the said provision, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force or instrument having the force of law, the owner of the motor vehicle or the authorised insurer shall be liable to pay compensation in the case of death or permanent disablement ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 18 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 due to accident arising out of the use of motor vehicle, compensation, as indicated in the Second Schedule, to the legal heirs or the victim, as the case may be.
26. In any claim for compensation under sub-section (1) of Section 163A, the claimant is not required to either plead or establish that the death or permanent disablement in respect of which the claim has been made was due to any wrongful act or neglect or default of the owner of the vehicle or vehicles concerned or of any other person.
27. It is therefore submitted that as a corollary, a claimant is duty bound to prove negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle for making a scheme under Section 166 of the Act.
28. As mentioned in the beginning of the order, under Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Tribunal is empowered to adjudicate on the claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving (i) death of, or (ii) body injury to, arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or (iii) damages to any property of a third party so arising or both. There is no ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 19 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 restriction or any mitigating circumstances, under which, the owner or the insurer can distance itself from the liability .
29. Further, Explanation to Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 declares that expression “claim for compensation in respect of accidents involving death of or body injury to persons, arising out of the use of motor vehicles” includes a claim for compensation under Sections 140 and Section 163-A of the Act.
30. Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 merely contemplates minimum requirements to be complied by insurance company.
31. The decisions which were rendered in the context of third party liability under the Act will not apply to a case where there is a comprehensive policy. It may also be propitious to refer to Circular No.IRDA/NL/F&U/073/11/2009 dated 16.11.2009 which is re-produced below:-
INSURANCE REGULATORY AND DEVELOPMENT ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 20 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 AUTHORITY :
Ref: IRDA/NL/CIR/F&U/073/11/2009 Dated :16.11.2009 To, CEOs of all general insurance companies Re: Liability of insurance companies in respect of occupants of a Private car and pillion rider on a two-wheeler under Standard Motor Package Policy (also called the Comprehensive Policy).
Insurers attention is drawn to wordings of Section II 1 (ii) of Standard Motor Package Policy (also called the Comprehensive Policy) for private car and two-wheeler under the (erstwhile) India Motor Tariff. For convenience the relevant provisions are reproduced hereunder:-
Section II - Liability to Third Parties
1. Subject to the limits of liabilities as laid down in the Schedule hereto the company will indemnify the insured in the event of an accident caused by or arising out of the use of the insured vehicle against all sums which the insured shall become legally liable to pay in respect of -
(i) death or bodily injury to any person including occupants carried in the vehicle (provided such occupants are not carried for hire or reward) but except so far as it is necessary to meet the requirements of Motor Vehicles Act, the Company shall not be liable where such death or injury arises out of and in the course of employment of such person by the insured.
It is further brought to the attention of insurers that the above provisions are in line with the following circulars earlier issued by the TAC on the subject:
(i) Circular M.V. No. l of 1978 - dated 18th March, 1978 (regarding occupants carried in Private Car) effective from 25th March, 1977.
(ii) MOT/GEN/10 dated 2nd June, 1986 (regarding pillion riders in a two- wheeler) effective from the date of the circular.
The above circulars make it clear that the insured liability in respect of occupant(s) carried in a private car and pillion rider carried on two-wheeler is covered under the Standard Motor Package Policy. A copy each of the above circulars is enclosed for ready reference.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 21 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 The Authority vide circular No. 066/IRDA/F&U/Mar-08 dated March 26, 2008 issued under File & Use Guidelines has reiterated that pending further orders the insurers shall not vary the coverage, terms and conditions wording, warranties, clauses and endorsements in respect of covers that were under the erstwhile tariffs. Further the Authority, vide circular No. 019/IRDA/NL/F&U/Oct-08 dated November 6, 2008 has mandated that insurers are not permitted to abridge the scope of standard covers available under the erstwhile tariffs beyond the options permitted in the erstwhile tariffs.
All general insurers are advised to adhere to the afore-mentioned circulars and any noncompliance of the same would be viewed seriously by the Authority.
This is issued with the approval of competent authority.

(Prabodh Chander) Executive Director"
32. The above circular is binding on all Insurance Companies.
Thus, a pillion rider is covered by the Standard Motr Policy. The insurer is liable to pay compensation to the legal representative(s) of the deceased.
33. Even though the liability is contractual, it is intended to a insulate and protect the injured or dependents of the deceased who may have the misfortune of meeting with an accident resulting in death or bodily injury, arising out of the use of motor vehicle while being carried ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 22 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 either as a passenger in a private passenger car or as a pillion rider.
34. In fact, the learned counsel for the appellant Insurance Company has also authored an article in (2012) 5 LW (JS) 1, wherein, he has opined as follows:-
35. The said Article was noticed after the case was reserved for passing orders.
36. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Asha Rani [(2003) 2 ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 23 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 SCC 223, it was held that the judgment in Satpal Singh case [(2000) 1 SCC 237 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 130] had been incorrectly decided and that the insurer will not be liable to pay compensation. In his concurring opinion, the Hon’ble Mr.Justice S.B. Sinha after contrasting the language used in the 1939 Act with that of the 1988 Act, observed as under:- (vide SCC p. 235, paras 25 and 27):
section (1) of Section 147 speaks of liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place, whereas sub-clause (ii) thereof deals with liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place.”
37. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Baljit Kaur, (2004) 2 ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 24 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 SCC 1, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the context of Section 147 (1)(b) of the Act, held as under:-
38. In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Tilak Singh, (2006) 4 SCC 404, the Court noting the above ratio held as under:-
39. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Balakrishnan, (2013) 1 SCC 731, the Court took note of the decision of the Delhi High Court in Yashpal Luthra case [2011 ACJ 1415 (Del)], wherein, the Delhi High Court observed as under:-
(2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 850, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:-
41. Noting the views expressed by the Delhi High Court in Yashpal Luthra case [2011 ACJ 1415 (Del), the Hon’ble Supreme Court in para 26 in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Balakrishnan, (2013) 1 SCC 731 observed as under:-
(2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 87 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 321] and, therefore, the matter was referred to a larger ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 27 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 Bench. We are disposed to think that there is no necessity to refer the present matter to a larger Bench as IRDA, which is presently the statutory authority, has clarified the position by issuing circulars which have been reproduced in the judgment by the Delhi High Court and we have also reproduced the same.
42. In Surender Kumar Arora Vs. Manoj Bisla, (2012) 4 SCC 552, the Court held as under:-
43. The above decisions was rendered in the context of unauthorised passenger albeit gratuitous passenger in a “goods carriage”.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 28 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019
44. In Reshma Kumari Vs. Madan Mohan, (2013) 9 SCC 65, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under:-
45. In New India Assurance Co., Ltd., Vs. Selvamani and others, 2015 ACJ 431, this Court held as under:
46. Since liability of the Insurance Company is contractual in the case of comprehensive policy, therefore, one has to necessarily go by the ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 29 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 terms of the insurance policy and the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Exhibit R2 prescribes the limitation as to the use under the policy. They are as follows:-
It is intended to cover the risk of not only an occupant but also the pillion rider of a two wheeler irrespective of the negligence of the owner of the vehicle, on which, the injured or deceased was travelling. Therefore, I do not find any reasons to differ with the views expressed by the Tribunal in the light of the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Balakrishnan, (2013) 1 SCC 731, in Jagtar Singh Vs. Sanjeev Kumar, (2018) 15 SCC 189 : (2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 850 and the views of Delhi High Court in Yashpal Luthra case [2011 ACJ 1415 (Del) and the views expressed by the learned counsel for the appellant Insurance Company in the above Article. Thus, the award amount is confirmed.
49. Therefore, the appellant Insurance Company is directed to deposit a sum of Rs.17,47,500/- together with interest at 7.5% per annum ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Page No 31 of 34 C.M.A.No.4127 of 2019 from the date of claim petition till the date of payment as was awarded by the Tribunal, less any amount already deposited, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this Judgment.
50. On such deposit, the first to fifth respondents are permitted to withdraw their shares in the same proportion awarded by the Tribunal together with interest, less any amount already withdrawn, by filing suitable application before the Tribunal.
51. Accordingly, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed. No cost.
