Issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ or order commanding respondents 2, 3 and 4 viz., State of Kerala represented by the Principal Secretary to the Government, the Transport Commissioner, and the Regional Transport Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram, to strictly enforce Section 136A of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Rule 151A of Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 to be equipped and fitted with Vehicle Location Tracking Device in all motor vehicles.

iii. Direct the respondents not to issue or renew fitness certificates to any vehicles in the State, which are not equipped or fitted with VLT devices and emergency buttons.

3. As both the writ petitions are filed for strict implementation of Vehicle Location Tracking Devices (VLTDs) in the motor vehicles, they are taken up together and disposed of by a common judgment
4. Facts leading to the filing of W.P.(C) No.20500 of 2020 are that the petitioner claims to be an Advisory Committee member of RAF (Road Accident Forum), for the State of Kerala. He is also a Human Rights Protection activist and was earlier president of Perumani Muslim Jamath Committee. Aggrieved by the non implementation of Government order dated 28.11.2016 and subsequent orders, he has approached this Court.
5. Petitioner has further stated that vide Exhibit-P1 notification dated 28.11.2016, amendment was made in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, by incorporating Rule 125H, which mandates installation of VLTD and emergency button. As per the said notification, the statute comes into force with effect from 01.04.2018. Thereafter, through Exhibit-P2 notification dated 25.10.2018, Central Government has exempted all the vehicles from fitting VLTDs and emergency buttons till 31st December, 2018. Power was given to the Government of the State and Union territories to notify the date of compliance of requirement.
6. Petitioner has further stated that in exercise of the powers conferred, State Government has issued Exhibit-P3 notification dated 28.11.2019, making 6 categories of public service vehicles to fix VLTDs and emergency buttons and also prescribed the time period, for each category of vehicles for installing tracking system and emergency buttons. The maximum time period fixed is now over. That being the situation, State Government have issued notification dated 17.02.2020 (Exhibit-P4), wherein again, extension was granted to KSRTC and stage carriages, and the reasons for such extension has been mentioned in the explanatory note.
7. Petitioner has further stated that in the year 2014, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved a scheme for enhancing the security for women in public road transport in the country. The objective of the scheme is to provide safe and secure public transport to the people of the country, particularly women and girl children, in the context of the "Nirbhaya case". With a view to achieve the said goal, Exhibit-P1 notification was issued by the Central Government, as early as in 2016. He has further contended that even though certain amendments and changes were made to Exhibit-P1 notification, the objective of the scheme is still in force. Moreover, the Central Government through various notifications under this scheme, had granted wide and ample powers to the State Governments, to formulate policies and to effectively and efficiently implement the scheme.
8. Petitioner has further stated that though Exhibits-P3 and P4 notifications were issued by the State Government, no effective steps were taken by respondents 2 to 5. It is understood that the State could not set up the command and control for implementing the Vehicle Tracking System. Hence, according to the petitioner, it is necessary to effectively implement the Vehicle Tracking System and to ensure safe travelling of women and children, especially girls, in public passenger transport vehicles.
9. Petitioner has further stated that now, the State Government has extended the time for fixing the VLTD and emergency button to KSRTC and Stage carriers. However, with regard to the other categories of vehicles, respondents are not taking any efforts to check whether vehicle tracking systems and emergency buttons have been fitted, in strict compliance of the Government orders.
10. Petitioner has further stated that the issue as regards ensuring safety for women and children in the country is not fully resolved, even during the 74th year of Independence. The news regarding atrocities against women and children are coming up from different areas day by day. It is in this context, a scheme introduced with the motive to ensure safety of women, children and general public, is not being implemented due to the delay and inefficiency on the part of respondents. In such circumstances, petitioner has filed the writ petition on the following grounds:

11. Facts leading to the filing of W.P.(C) No.20768 of 2020 are that the petitioner claims to be a registered Association viz., 'Pouravakasha Samrakshana Council' under the Travancore Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Registration Act, 1955, formed with the objective of doing voluntary work as regards road safety and to enlighten the general public about traffic culture by associating with the Motor Vehicles Department.
12. The issue involved in this writ petition is to the non-implementation of Section 136A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Rule 151A of Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, in respect of fitment of Electronic Monitoring System with location tracking devices, in all the public service vehicles and goods carriage vehicles.
13. Petitioner has further stated that Rule 125-H has been inserted in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 w.e.f 01.04.2018, for providing Vehicle Location Tracking Device (VLTD, in short) and emergency button, in all the public service vehicles, as defined under Section 2(35) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Thereafter, the State Government has also amended the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, by inserting Rule 151 A, making it mandatory that all the public service vehicles (any motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward, and includes a maxi-cab, a motor-cab contract carriage) except  auto rickshshaws/three wheelers  e Rickshaws  any transport vehicle for which no permit is required registered on and after 1st January 2019, will have to be equipped and fitted with Vehicle Location Tracking (VLT) with emergency buttons. According to the petitioner, this regulation is being brought in to ensure safety of passengers, especially women.
14. Petitioner has further stated that the Central Government has given temporary exemption to all the public service vehicles registered upto December 31, 2018, for compliance of the requirements, after the amendments. It was clarified that after expiry of the time period of exemption specified, the concerned State or Union Territory will notify the date. Thereafter, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of Kerala, have issued an order dated 28.11.2019 (Exhibit-P2), granting exemption upto certain dates, from installation of GPS in the vehicles mentioned therein. Government of Kerala, by Circular No.19/2019 dated 1.1.2020, have appointed the Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement), Thiruvananthapuram, as the Nodal Officer, for effective implementation of the scheme.
15. Petitioner has further contended that even though the cut off date fixed by the State Government for enforcement of Rule 151A of the rules, has expired long back, the requirement under the amended Act and the rules has not been implemented or enforced in the State. The non installation of VLT devices is against public interest. The intention of the respondents in not enforcing the fitment to goods vehicles is mala fide and would tantamount to corruption. In such circumstances, petitioner has filed this writ petition on the following grounds:

16. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, represented by the Managing Director, Trivandrum (respondent No.7 in W.P.(C) No.20500/2020), has filed a counter affidavit, wherein it is contended as follows:

17. Secretary to the Government, Transport Department, respondent No.2 in W.P.(C) No.20768/2020, has filed a statement, wherein it is contended as follows:

18. On the grounds made in W.P.(C) No.20768 of 2020, Mr. M.P. Ashok Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that for the implementation of Motor Vehicles, Act, 1988, Union of India, represented by its Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, New Delhi, respondent No.1, has already allotted about Rs.13 Crores. All the offices of the Motor Vehicle Department are to be equipped with modern instruments to monitor the VLT devices. For ensuring installation of most modern technical devices, the 1st respondent has already allotted funds to 15 States in India and Kerala is one among them. He further submitted that despite receipt of the fund, the Government of Kerala is exempting goods vehicles, due to extraneous consideration.
19. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that by Exhibit-P2 notification dated 28.11.2019, certain category of goods vehicles were exempted from the provisions of the KMV Rules, 1989 upto 31.11.2019. However, in the said notification, goods vehicles were exempted from fitment of VLT devices only upto 29.02.2020. According to the learned counsel, the said date fixed by the Government was after accepting the report of the expert committee, appointed in that regard. Thereafter, Government of Kerala have issued Exhibit-P4 order dated 17.02.2020 amending Exhibit-P2 notification. Government has taken a decision not to grant exemption to goods vehicles, because the maximum number of accidents and various other illegal activities are taking place in the goods vehicles.
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that this Court in W.P.(C) No.20500/2020, passed an interim order dated 30.9.2020 directing that steps have to be taken to install VLTDs, in respect of other categories of vehicles and, therefore, it is mandatory on the part of the State Government to ensure compliance. But, the State Government, based on the request made by the Association of Goods Motor Vehicle Industry, vide Exhibit-P5 notification dated 2.10.2020, have extended the time limit for installation of VLTD for goods vehicles upto 31.12.2020. Thus, the executive authorities are diluting the law by subverting the mandate.
21. Mr. Praveen K. Joy, learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.20500 of 2020, also made submissions in terms of the contentions recorded above.
22. Based on the counter affidavit of the KSRTC, 7 th respondent in W.P. (C) No.20500/2020, and the statement of the Secretary to the Government, Transport Department, respondent No.2 in W.P.(C) No.20768/2020, Mr. P. C. Chacko, learned standing counsel for the KSRTC, and the the learned Special Govt Pleader submitted that though the Central Government have framed rules directing installation of VLTDs and later on exempted the same in respect W.P.(C)s. 20500 & 20768/2020 27 of goods carriage vehicles, Government of Kerala, in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 110 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 framed Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, directing all kinds of vehicles to be fitted with VLTDs, except two wheeler, E‐rickshaw, three wheelers; and any transport vehicle for which no permit is required under the Act. They further submitted that in respect of educational institution buses, installation of the VLTD has been completed. Having regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the financial position of Kerala Road Transport Corporation, there is a delay in implementing Rule 151A of the rules and there is no willful or deliberate intention on the part of the Corporation or the State Government.
23. Learned Special Government Pleader further submitted that considering the request of the Association of Goods Carriages, time for fitting the vehicle location tracking devices has been extended upto 31.12.2020, but it is not a case of exemption, as argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.20678/2020. He further submitted that when power to grant exemption from fitting the VLTDs is conferred on the State Government, it can do so, but, having regard to the object of locating the vehicles, goods carriage vehicles are also included. He also submitted that the State Government has power to extend the time, having regard to the various factors stated supra, and extension of time granted cannot be said to be arbitrary or mala fide.
W.P.(C)s. 20500 & 20768/2020 28
24. Learned Special Government Pleader further submitted that in the case of vehicles coming from other States to Kerala, there is a difficulty in implementing the scheme, and therefore, it is decided to address the Central Government. Finally, the learned Special Government Pleader submitted that Transport Commissionerate, Government of Kerala, has also issued Circular No.19/2019 dated 01.01.2020, appointing the Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement), Thiruvananthapuram, as the Nodal Officer, for Global Positioning System in the State. The Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement) in the respective districts will be the Nodal Officer for effective monitoring of GPS in the districts. Therefore it is submitted that Government of Kerala is taking all necessary steps to effectively implement installation of VLTDs, in all the vehicles, except those mentioned in Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and the contentions to the contrary, made in the writ petitions cannot be countenanced. For the above, he prayed to dismiss the writ petitions.
25. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record.
26. Before adverting to the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties with reference to the rules and notifications, let us consider a few statutory provisions.

27. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to motor vehicles. Section 2(35) of the Act defines "public service vehicles" as under:

28. Section 56 of the Act speaks about certificate of fitness of transport vehicles and the same reads thus:

29. Section 110 of the Act speaks about the power of the Central Government to make rules and it reads thus:


39. Notification dated 17.02.2020 [Exhibit-P4 in W.P.(C) No.20500/ 2020), amendment to the notification dated 28.11.2019, reads thus:

40. Reading of the above, makes it clear that considering the representation of various associations of the Motor Vehicle Industry and the financial crisis of the Kerala State Transport Corporation, Government of Kerala have decided to extend the time for compliance of installing VLTDs upto 31.12.2020, and that there is no exemption, as submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.20768/2020.
41. Notification dated 22.10.2020 [Exhibit-P5 in W.P(C) No.20768/2020) amending G.O(P) No.41/2019/Tran dated 28th November, 2019, reads thus:

42. Perusal of the above makes it clear that various associations of the Goods Motor Vehicle Industry have approached the State Government to extend the time limit for installation of VLTDs, for goods vehicles, upto 31 st December, 2020, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, and accordingly extended the time for compliance.
43. Circular No.19/2019 dated 01.01.2020 issued by the Transport Commissioner, Transport Commissionerate, Thiruvananthapuram, is extracted hereunder:

46. It is the contention of the Government that pursuant to the introduction of Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, with effect from 1.4.2018, installation of VLTDs in educational institution buses and vehicles carrying school children is over.
47. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, 7 th respondent in W.P.(C) No.20500 of 2020, has also stated that process for purchasing VLTDs has been initiated, tender has been invited on 28.09.2020 for purchasing the 1 st phase of devices, and it is in the final stage. According to the KSRTC, there are 6200 buses and they have incurred huge expenses. Though COVID-19 pandemic has been cited as one of the reasons, besides payment of salary to the employees, expenditure incurred in maintenance etc., the same cannot be accepted for the reason, from 1.4.2018, Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 is in force.
48. In fact restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic started only in March 2020. Income and expenditure of the Kerala Road Transport Corporation is not a new feature, insofar as the Corporation is concerned. When the State Legislature, in exercise of the powers under Section 110(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, has framed Rule 151A in the rules, and periodically issued orders, including Circular No.19/2019 dated 1.1.2020, appointing Nodal W.P.(C)s. 20500 & 20768/2020 49 Officers, for monitoring the implementation of installation of VLTDs and Emergency buttons, the same has to be done effectively, towards enforcement of the rule. Contention of the petitioner that action of the Government of Kerala, in extending the time for implementation of installation of VLTDs is arbitrary and mala fide cannot be accepted.
49. Since 1.4.2018, the date on which Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 has come into force, and more than 2 ½ years have elapsed. That apart submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that a sum of Rs.13 Crores is allotted for the purpose of equipping the offices of the Motor Vehicles Department in Kerala, has already been received by the Government of Kerala, is not specifically refuted by the respondents.
50. Having regard to the object of framing Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, safety of the commuters, in particular, women and children, and taking note of the periodical orders issued by the Government of Kerala, a duty is cast upon them to implement the rule and the notifications, without any further delay. As regards enforcement of the rules, notifications and circular, the difficulty expressed by the Government with respect to the vehicles coming from other States, exempting the above said vehicles, is just and reasonable.
In the light of the above discussion, we dispose of the Writ Petitions directing the Secretary to the Government, Transport Department, State of W.P.(C)s. 20500 & 20768/2020 50 Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, respondent No.2 in W.P.(C) No.20768 of 2020, to effectively implement Rule 151A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, notifications, and Circular No.19/2019, with effect from 1.1.2021.
