Before hearing the arguments, the petitioner submitted a lease agreement and an application dated 21.02.2012. Copies of the original lease agreement is in the record and it has been placed by the State Government. By the aforesaid lease agreement a vehicle bearing number MP07 P-0767 was leased out in favour of the petitioner with effect from 22.02.2012 to 28.02.2013 for the purpose of plying the vehicle on route Gwalior to Tikamgarh. Considering the application of the petitioner, the Regional Transport Authority granted the permanent permit in favour of the petitioner for the route Gwalior to Tikamgarh with one return trip daily.
The objector filed an appeal before the STAT against the aforesaid order. The STAT vide its order dated 23.10.2013 allowed the appeal after holding that the petitioner had a leased vehicle hence he could not be said to be the owner of the vehicle in view of Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Against the said order, a writ petition was filed which was also 2 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
dismissed by this Court vide order dated 05.03.2014 under review herein which goes as under:
107, 111, 138, 159, 176, 211 and 213 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (No.59 of 1988). Rule 72 of the Rules of 1994 prescribes forms of application for permit. In accordance with the aforesaid Rule 72 (1) of the Rules of 1994, every application for grant of permit in respect of any transport vehicle shall be in one of the following forms and in accordance with the aforesaid rule 72 (3)(a) in respect of stage carriage permit, it would be in the form M.P.M.V.R.-42 (S.C.P.A.). Rule 72 (3) (b) of the Rules of 1994 prescribes that an application of stage carriage permit shall be accompanied by certain documents and one of the condition is of certificate of registering authority in regard to ownership of vehicle of the applicant.
Relevant rule is as under :-
(b) "certificate from Registering Authority containing make, model and seating capacity of the vehicles owned by the applicant at the time of making the application:"
Appropriate form M.P.M.V.R.-42 (S.C.P.A.) has also been prescribed in accordance with rule, which is part VI of the Rules of 1994. Clause 8 of the form is in regard to details of the vehicle which is to be offered to operate on the route applied for :
8. Details of the vehicle offered to operate on the route applied for :-
Vehicle No....................Model........................... Make..................... Seating Capacity.............. (Proof to be enclosed). There is also provision of reserved vehicle.
From the aforesaid statutory rule, it is clear that the applicant must be the owner of the vehicle at the time of making the application because in 4 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
Rule 72 (3) (b) of the Rules of 1994, the word used "vehicles owned by the applicant".
The petitioner filed an application for grant of permanent permit on 20.2.2012. He submitted a lease agreement, by which he had taken a vehicle on lease from another person Suresh Pateria, before the authority which was executed on 21.2.2012.
This fact clearly established that the petitioner did not have had vehicle of his own or any leased vehicle in his favour at the time of filing an application. A copy of the application filed by the petitioner and a copy of the lease agreement has been filed by M/s Orchha Transport Company, respondent No.2 in W.P.No.7057/2013. Hence, the petitioner did not fulfill the criteria as required in the rules.
The arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the lease agreement was in favour of the petitioner, hence, he was the owner of the vehicle, could not be accepted because as held earlier in this order that on the date of filing of the application there was no lease agreement in favour of the petitioner. In such circumstances, in our opinion, the STAT has rightly quashed the grant of permit in favour of the petitioner.
Consequently, we do not find any merit in this petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution. It is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs."
Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submitted that a leased vehicle was in favour of the petitioner at the time of hearing of the arguments on the application of the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner had fulfilled 5 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
all the requirements for the purpose of grant of permit. While passing the order under review this Court has held that the petitioner had no lease agreement at the time of filing of the application hence, it could not be held that the petitioner was eligible to receive the permit.
It is a fact that the petitioner offered a vehicle at the time of submitting the application which was of 2002 model and before hearing the arguments the petitioner submitted a lease agreement dated 21.02.2012. By the said agreement, a vehicle of 2011 model was leased out in favour of the petitioner.
The question whether a person requires to fulfill all the conditions on the date of filing of the application or on the date of hearing of the arguments in regard to grant of permanent permit has been considered by this court in Padam Chand Gupta and another Vs. State Transport Authority and another reported in 2014(1) MPLJ 124 in which it has been held as under:
condition is of certificate of registering authority in regard to ownership of vehicle of the applicant. Relevant rule is as under :-
13. Appropriate form M.P.M.V.R.-42 (S.C.P.A.) has also been prescribed in accordance with rule, which is part VI of the Rules of 1994. Clause 8 of the form is in regard to details of the vehicle which is to be offered to operate on the route applied for:
14. From the aforesaid statutory provisions, it is clear that an applicant has to submit details of the vehicle, which was offered by him to operate on the route and he must be the owner of the vehicle at the time of making application which is the requirement of Rule 72 (3)(b) of the Rules of 1994 as mentioned above in the order.
15. At the time of making an application the respondent No.2 had leased out the vehicle to some other person.
16. The question that whether an application for stage carriage permit could be rejected on the ground that the particulars of the vehicle being used for the services were not mentioned at the time of submitting the application has been considered by the Full Bench of Kerala High Court in E.L. Narayanan and others Vs. R.T.A. Trichur reported in AIR 1980 Kerala 115. Full 7 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
Bench has held as under :-
17. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Mangruloir Joint Motor Service Co. (P) Ltd. reported in AIR 1971 SC 1804 has held as under in this regard :-
8 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
"The High court was in error on the second question in holding that the Regional Transport Authority would have to consider the respective qualifications of the applicants as on the date of their applications and not as on the date of the actual consideration by the applications for the grant of permit."
18. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Esskey Roadways (Firm) Vs. Anandhakrishnan Bus Service reported in AIR 1994 SC 71 has held as under in regard to consideration of relevant date on which the respective claims of the candidates have to be considered for grant of permit :-
19. It is clear from the above judgments that an applicant has to fulfill qualification required in the rule and in regard to availability of the vehicle at the time of passing of the order by the Regional Transport Authority.
20. Respondent No.2 had leased out his vehicle, which was proposed to be plied by him on the route in favour of the another person and it was covered by another permit up to 31.8.2012, thereafter it was released when the permit was surrendered before the RTA. The tax of the vehicle was also paid up to 31.8.2012. Hence, in our opinion, the respondent No.2 did not fulfill the criteria having a vehicle at the time of passing of the order by R.T.A. for grant of permanent permit, hence, he was not eligible to receive the permit.
21. The aforesaid facts and legal position has not been considered by the STAT in the impugned order. Apart from this, respondent No.2 has been favoured by granting unfair timings. Even though the case could be remanded back to the R.T.A. to fix the timings, however, we have held that the respondent No.2 was not eligible for grant of permit because he did not have the vehicle, which could be pressed in service or plied on the route at the time of passing of the order by the R.T.A. It is a necessary requirement in accordance with the rules and statutory form.
22. Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 relied on the Balwant Rao Vs. State judgment of this court in Transport Appellate Authority reported in Short Note 59 of 1971 MPLJ 34.
23. Facts of the case have not been mentioned in the aforesaid decision, hence, we could not take the 10 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
assistance from the aforesaid judgment.
24. Counsel for the respondent No.2 also relied on the Smt.Aysha Vs. Regional judgment in the case of Transport Authority reported in AIR 2006 Kerala 360 and some unreported judgments.
25. The aforesaid judgments cited by the by the learned counsel for respondent No.2 do not favour the case of respondent No.2, hence they are distinguishable.
26. Consequently, the petition field by the petitioners is allowed. Grant of permanent permit in favour of respondent No.2 by RTA of route Gwalior to Jhansi via Dabra, Datia of one return trip is hereby quashed. The impugned order dt.4.7.2013 (Annexure P/1) passed by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal Gwalior is hereby quashed. No order as to costs." After considering the earlier judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the judgment rendered by the Full Bench of Hon'ble Kerala High Court, this Court had held that the applicant has to fulfill qualification required in the rule and in regard to availability of the vehicle at the time of passing of the order by the Regional Transport Authority.
In the present case, petitioner had submitted a leased agreement on 21.02.2012 and the arguments on the application were heard on 25.02.2012. Subsequently, the order was passed. Hence, the petitioner had fulfilled the criteria in accordance with the judgment of the Division Bench. In the order under review, the judgment passed by the Division Bench has not been considered. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kamlesh Verma Vs. Mayawati and others reported in (2013) 8 SCC 320 has held as under:
11 RP.133.2014 Rishikesh Singh Vs. Smt. Seema Arora and others.
"The principles relating to review jurisdiction may be summarised as follows:
Looking to the principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in our opinion, the review petition is hereby maintainable.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Industrial Credit and Development Syndicate Limited Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Mysore and another reported in (2013) 3 SCC 541 has held that in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, there is formed a deeming provision creating a legal fiction of ownership in favour of the lessee only for the purpose of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The findings of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are as under:

Hence, the petitioner was the owner of the vehicle.
Lease agreement dated 21.02.2012 was filed before the RTO. In view of the aforesaid, review petition is hereby allowed.
