Karnataka High Court
The Claim Manager vs Mahadevi on 12 January, 2021
Author: Alok Aradhe Rangaswamy
This appeal under Section 173(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act is filed by the insurer challenging the liability imposed upon it to pay the compensation awarded in terms of the Judgment and Award dated 12.05.2016 by the III Additional District Judge and MACT., Mysuru in MVC No.538/2011.

2. Though, this appeal is listed for admission, as the records of the Tribunal are received it is taken up for final disposal with the consent of the counsel for the parties.

3. The parties shall henceforth be referred to as they were arrayed before the Tribunal.
4. The claim petition discloses that the claimant and others were on a pilgrimage to places in North India and Nepal by a bus bearing registration No.KA-09-A-3344 (hereinafter referred to as "offending bus" for short). It is stated that on 29.05.2010, when they were returning to India from Nepal at about 3.15 am., the bus fell into a ravine and the passengers suffered serious injuries. The claimant also suffered injuries and was treated at College of Medical Science - Teaching Hospital, Bharathpura Chitwan, Nepal and later continued treatment at Vikram Jeev Hospital. The claimant had suffered an amputation of her right arm. The police in Nepal had registered Crime No.2066/067 under Section 147, 161(2) and 162(2) of the Transportation Arrangement Act. The claimant filed a claim petition under Section 166 of the MV Act claiming compensation of a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- from the owner and the insurer of the offending bus. The claimant claimed that she was earning a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month from tailoring, embroidery and sale of sarees.
5. The driver - owner of the offending bus contested the claim petition and claimed that on 29.05.2010, it was snowing at 3.15 am., and due to bright headlamp of a vehicle coming from the opposite direction, the driver moved the vehicle to the left side of the road and hit a road side rock which caused a land slide and the bus fell into the ravine. He admitted that the claimant was a passenger and was suffered injuries. The insurer though entered appearance did not file its written statement but only filed a memo claiming that the Tribunal did not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition.
6. The claim petition was initially dismissed by the Tribunal on the ground of want of territorial jurisdiction in terms of the order dated 16.11.2011 which was reversed by this Court in MFA No.1829/2012. Later, the insurer filed its statement of objections and reiterated that the accident occurred outside India and that the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was not applicable for the accidents outside India. It however, admitted that the offending bus was covered by a policy of insurance issued by it. It contended that the policy covered only the geographical area of India and not beyond and if the insurance was to cover beyond India, then the insured had to pay an additional premium and obtain a specific endorsement to that effect on the insurance policy. It claimed that the owner had not paid any additional premium.
7. The claimant was examined as PW1 and examined three other witnesses as PWs.2, 3 and 4 and marked documents as Exs.P1 to P23. While, the owner of the offending bus was examined as RW1 and the State Legal Head of the insurer was examined as RW2 and they marked documents as Exs.R1 to R9.

8. The Tribunal noticed that the accident which occurred on 29.05.2010 is not seriously disputed by the respondents, since the driver - owner of the offending bus had categorically admitted about the accident. The claimant who was traveling by the offending bus deposed that the driver of the offending bus was driving it rash and negligently and since he took a sharp turn, the vehicle fell down from the top of a hill. The Tribunal therefore, held that the accident was due to the rash and negligent driving by the driver of the offending bus.

9. While considering the principal contention of the insurer that it owed no obligation to indemnify the owner of the offending bus against any claim for compensation as the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was not applicable to the accident which occurred in Nepal, the Tribunal noticed Sections 1, 139 and 166(2) and held even if the accident had occurred in Nepal, the claimant was entitled to file a claim petition in India. It also noticed the contention of the insurer that as per the Indian Motor Tariff Regulations, an insurer could cover the risk if the owner had paid additional premium as prescribed under General Regulation No.4 of the Indian Motor Tariff Regulations. Hence, the Tribunal held that it had the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition.
10. In so far as the claim for compensation is concerned, the Tribunal considered the evidence of PWs.2 and 3 who were the customers of the claimant who deposed that they use to avail the tailoring and embroidery services of the claimant. Hence, the Tribunal considered the notional income of the claimant at a sum of Rs.6,000/- per month. It also noticed the evidence of PW4 who was the doctor who treated and assessed the disability of the claimant at 89% as the claimant had suffered an amputation of her right arm. The Tribunal assessed the disability at 50% and taking into account the period of treatment undergone by the claimant at Nepal and in Mysuru, it awarded the following compensation.
11. Feeling aggrieved by the Judgment and Award passed by the Tribunal, the insurer of the offending bus is in appeal. It is contended that no positive evidence was placed on record to prove the cause of the alleged accident and therefore, the Tribunal could not have assumed that the driver of the offending bus was negligent in driving the vehicle and causing the accident. It also contended that Section 1 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 prescribes the application of the Act to the whole of India and the vehicle registered in India could be taken outside India only after obtaining traveling pass or certificate or authorization under Section 139 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. It also contended that Section 166(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is not applicable as the place of accident is outside India and the owner of the offending bus was not paid the additional premium of a sum of Rs.100/- to extend the policy of insurance when the offending bus was in Nepal.
12. Per contra, the learned counsel for the claimant contended that the owner of the offending bus had a policy of insurance which covered the offending bus. He also obtained a special permit dated 29.04.2010 which indicated that the offending bus was permitted to travel to Katmandu, Nepal. The learned counsel contended that the offending bus was checked by the Nepal authorities at the border and were permitted to travel into Nepal. He contended that the claimant was entitled to lodge a claim in Mysuru by virtue of Section 166(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

13. We have given our anxious consideration to the arguments canvassed by the learned counsel for the parties and we have perused the records of the Tribunal as well as its Judgment and Award.

14. Dealing with the first question regarding the applicability of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, Section 1 of the Motor Vehicles Act declares that it shall extend to the whole of India. However, Section 139 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 permits the Central Government to make Rules for the purpose of grant and authentication of travel pass / certificate or authorization to persons temporarily taking motor vehicles outside India and may for this purpose frame Rules in respect of the matters contained therein. For the sake of convenience, Section 139 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is extracted below:
(b) prescribing the conditions subject to which motor vehicles brought temporarily into India from outside India by persons intending to make a temporary stay in India may be possessed and used in India; and
(c) prescribing the conditions subject to which persons entering India from any place outside India for a temporary stay in India may drive motor vehicles in India. (2) For the purpose of facilitating and regulating the services of motor vehicles operating between India and any other country under any reciprocal arrangement and carrying passengers or goods or both by road for hire or reward, the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules with respect to all or any of the following matters, namely:--
(a) the conditions subject to which motor vehicles carrying on such services may be brought into India from outside India and possessed and used in India;
(b) the conditions subject to which motor vehicles may be taken from any place in India to any place outside India;
(c) the conditions subject to which persons employed as drivers and conductors of such motor vehicles may enter or leave India;
(e) the particulars (other than registration marks) to be exhibited by such motor vehicles and the manner in which such particulars are to be exhibited;
(f) the use of trailers with such motor vehicles;
(g) the exemption of such motor vehicles and their drivers and conductors from all or any or the provisions of this Act [other than those referred to in sub-section (4)] of the rules made thereunder ;
(h) the identification of the drivers and conductors of such motor vehicles;
(i) the replacement of the travelling passes, certificates or authorisations, permits, licences or any other prescribed documents lost or defaced, on payment of such fee as may be prescribed;
(j) the exemption from the provisions of such laws as relate to customs, police or health with a view to facilitate such road transport services;
(k) any other matter which is to be, or may be, prescribed.
(3) No rule made under this section shall operate to confer on any person any immunity in any State from the payment of any tax levied in that State on motor vehicles or their users.
(4) Nothing in this Act or in any rule made thereunder by a State Government relating to--
(c) the licensing and the qualifications of drivers and conductors of motor vehicles, shall apply--
(i) to any motor vehicle to which or to any driver of a motor vehicle to whom any rules made under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub-
15. A perusal of Section 139(2) does not mandate that a person taking his motor vehicle outside India should also obtain appropriate insurance coverage to operate the vehicle outside India. It is noted that the owner - driver of the offending bus had obtained the required permissions to take the vehicle outside India and merely because an additional premium of Rs.100/- was not paid for a geographical extension of the area, the insurer cannot escape its liability to pay the compensation. A perusal of Sections 146 and 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 makes it clear that the insurance policy is attached to the vehicle in question and this position would not change on the area where the vehicle is put to use, so long as such area is a public place. Once the vehicle is insured and is permitted to ply in any area, then it is deemed that such vehicle carries with a policy of insurance. In similar circumstances, the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Anil Kumar Vs. Roop Kumar Sharma and another reported in 2019 ACJ 381 held that an insurer cannot avoid liability on the ground that the accident occurred outside India and that no additional premium was paid for plying outside India. It is relevant to note that the offending bus was registered in Karnataka and both the claimant and the owner of the offending bus are citizens of India and are thus, bound by the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The extra-territorial jurisdiction of a sovereign State qua its citizens, is a well entrenched jurisprudential concept. Yet another provision which palpably runs counter to the contention of the insurer in this case is Section 149(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 which warrants that a Judgment of a foreign Court or by a Court in a reciprocating Country shall be honoured by the insurer, notwithstanding the fact that such insurer is either registered or not in such reciprocating Country. Thus, if the insurer is bound to honour a foreign award, it would be preposterous to contend that the insurer is not liable to honour a Judgment and Award passed in India, on the ground that the accident occurred in India. In that view of the matter, the insurer cannot escape its liability on the ground that owner of the offending bus had not paid an additional premium.

16. In so far as the maintainability of the claim petition before the Tribunal, Section 166(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 reads as follows:

17. Since, the claimant was a resident of Mysuru, she has opted to file the claim petition at Mysuru and therefore, the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to adjudicate the petition filed before it by the claimant.
18. In so far as the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is concerned, it had considered a sum of Rs.6,000/- per month as the notional income of the claimant which is on par with the notional income prescribed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority in respect of persons who do not have any proof of income and who die or are injure in the road traffic accident in the year 2010. The Tribunal had considered the evidence of PW4 and held that due to the amputation of the right arm of the claimant, she had suffered disability of 89% as deposed of PW4. The Tribunal therefore factored 30% of her notional income as the 'loss of future income' and awarded a sum of Rs.15,86,731/- which in the opinion of this Court is just and reasonable and does not call for interference.

Hence, the appeal filed by the insurer is dismissed. The amount in deposit shall be transferred to the Tribunal for appropriate orders.
