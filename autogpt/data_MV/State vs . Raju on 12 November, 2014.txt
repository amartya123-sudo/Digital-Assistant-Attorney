APPRECIATION OF FACTS/CONTENTIONS/ANALYSIS & FINDINGS
18. At the outset, it is pertinent to mention here that it is not in dispute that the accused was driver of the offending TSR on the date of incident in question and struck his TSR against the deceased which resulted into his death as is clear from statement of accused under Section 313 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 read with Section 281 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
19.(i).(a) In this matter, the only and main contention of the defence is that no rashness and negligence can be inferred in this matter, therefore, accused should be acquitted in this matter.
19.(i).(b) On the other hand, it is the contention of the prosecution that rashness and negligent can be inferred in the present circumstances as accused was driving offending vehicle in fast speed under the influence of alcohol. 19.2 A rash act is primarily an over hasty act. It is opposed to a deliberate act and the term "Rash Act" denotes the want of proper care and caution. Criminal rashness is hazarding a dangerous act with the knowledge that it is so, and that it may cause injury, but without intention to cause injury or knowledge that it will probably be caused. The criminality lies in running the risk of doing such an act with recklessness or in difference as to consequences.
On the other hand, negligence is a breach of duties imposed by law. Negligence may be either civil or criminal negligence depending upon the nature and gravity of negligence. Criminal negligence is gross neglect or failure to exercise reasonable and proper care and precaution to guard against injury, either to public generally, or to an individual in particular, which having regard to all circumstances out of which the charge has arisen, it was the duty of the person to have adopted. So, negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those contradictions which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. 19.3 Now, if we examine the deposition of PW6 then the only circumstance qua rash and negligent driving is that the three wheeler was at fast speed. From the evidence of PW6 and Ex.PW12/D, it is clear that the three wheeler was coming on its correct side. It was the deceased who was crossing the road for the other side. There is no evidence to the effect that the deceased was crossing the road on some green light or it was a zebra crossing. Fast speed is a relative term and fast speed does not necessarily means rash driving unless the circumstances are shown where driving in a fast speed itself amount to rashness such as if place of occurrence is crowded place. No such evidence is on record to show that it was crowded place. No clarification has been brought on record by the prosecution as to what PW6 meant by fast speed. The person who is driving the vehicle on a straight road is not expected to see whether someone wants to cross the road or not, but it is upon the person who wants to cross the road to see that the vehicle should not be approaching from the either side before crossing.
19.4 In matter of "State of Karnataka Vs. Satish" (1998) 8 SCC 493, it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Para 4 and Para 5 as under :­ Para 4. "..........Criminality is not to be presumed, subject of course to some statutory exceptions. There is no such statutory exception pleaded in the present case. In the absence of any material on the record, no presumption of "rashness" or "negligence" could be drawn by invoking the maxim "res ipsa loquitur......."
Para 5. " There being no evidence on the record to establish "negligence" or "rashness" in driving the truck on the part of the respondent, it cannot be said that the view taken by High Court in acquitting the respondent is a perverse view........."
In matter of "Abdul Subhann Vs. State" 2007 CRI.L.J. 1089, it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Para 10 and Para 11 as under :­ Para 10. ".........in a criminal trial, the burden of proving everything essential to the establishment of charge against an accused always rests on the prosecution and there is presumption of innocence in favour of the accused until the contrary is proved. Criminality is not to be presumed, subject of course to some statutory exceptions. There is no such statutory exception pleaded in the present case. In the absence of any material on the record, no presumption of "rashness" or "negligence could be drawn by invoking the maxim "res ipsa loquitur........."
Para 11 ".........As observed in Badri Prasad (supra), to establish the offence either under Section 279 or Section 304A, the commission of a rash and negligent act has to be proved. The only distinction being that in Section 279, rash and negligent act relates to the manner of driving or riding on a public way while the offence under Section 304A extends to any rash and negligent act falling short of culpable homicide. As correctly observed by the learned Judge, the rashness or negligence which needs to be established is something more than a mere error of judgment. There is also a distinction between rashness and negligence in that rashness conveys the idea of doing a reckless act without considering any of its consequences whereas negligence connotes want of proper care..........".
In matter of "Mohammed Aynuddin @ Miyam Vs. State of A.P." AIR 2000 SC 2411, it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Para 9 and 10 as under :­ Para 9. " The principle of res ipsa loquitor is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence. The said principles has application only when the nature of the accident and the attending circumstances would reasonably lead to the belief that in the absence of negligence the accident would not have occurred and that the thing which caused injury is shown to have been under the management and control of the alleged wrong doer".
Para 10. " A rash act is primarily an over hasty act. It is opposed to a deliberate act. Still a rash act can be a deliberate act in the sense that it was done without due care and caution. Culpable rashness lies in running the risk of doing an act with recklessness and with indifference as to the consequences. Criminal negligence is that failure to exercise duty with reasonable and proper care and precaution guarding against injury to the public generally or to any individual in particular.........".
19.5 In view of above­said judgments, if we consider the case in hand then there is no clarity as to exactly or around at what speed the vehicle was driven by accused. The rashness and negligence in driving the vehicle is not clearly made out from the evidence educed by the prosecution. Coupled with this fact that it was the deceased who was crossing the road to get on other side of the road without any zebra­crossing or green light and the accused was on his own side, this Court is not convinced that rash and negligence in driving of the TSR by its driver i.e. accused is made out from the facts and circumstances before this Court. Now as far as the contention of prosecution that since the accused was under the influence of alcohol, therefore, rashness and negligence can be presumed is concerned, in the opinion of this Court, driving the vehicle under the influence of alcohol is a separate offence and just because a person is under the influence of alcohol, it does not necessarily mean or even cannot be inferred that he was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. Moreover, driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol is punishable under Section 185 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 only when the quantity of liquor is more than 30 mg/100 ml in the blood. No such evidence is on record that the quantity of liquor was more than 30 mg/100 ml, therefore, there is no force in the said contention of prosecution that it can be presumed that accused was rash and negligent in driving as he was under the influence of alcohol. In these circumstances, accused is entitled to benefit of doubt for offences punishable under Section 279 and 304A of The Indian Penal Code, 1860.
20. As already discussed qua question of commission of offence punishable under Section 185 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, though it has been mentioned in the MLC Ex.PW9/A that smell of alcohol was coming, but in the said MLC itself, it has been mentioned that though alcohol consumed, but not under influence of it. Further though, the accused has admitted in his statement under Section 313 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 read with Section 218 of The Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 that he had taken some liquor on the day of incident, but it is not proved on record that the quantity of liquor intake was above 30 mg/100 ml, therefore, the accused cannot be convicted for offence punishable under Section 185 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
21. Now as far the question of commission of offence qua Section 3 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Section 181 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is concerned, the accused has himself admitted in his statement under Section 313 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 read with Section 281 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 that he was driving the vehicle without having any valid driving license. The PW12 has also deposed that accused was not having any valid driving license. In view of the statement of PW12 and the admission of accused, accused is liable to be held guilty for offence punishable under Section 3 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Section 181 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
22. In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, accused is hereby given benefit of doubt for offences punishable under Section 279 and 304A of The Indian Penal Code, 1860 and for offence punishable under Section 185 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Accordingly, accused Raju stands acquitted for the offences punishable under Section 279 and 304A of The Indian Penal Code, 1860 and for offence punishable under Section 185 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. However, accused Raju stands convicted for the offence punishable under Section 3 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Section 181 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
23. Copy of judgment be supplied to convict free of costs.
Announced in the open Court on November 12, 2014.
