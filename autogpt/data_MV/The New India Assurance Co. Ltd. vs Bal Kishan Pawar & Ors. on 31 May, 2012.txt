The deceased was also taking tuitions in his spare time and was earning `1,800/- per month. The deceased wanted to join defence services and he submitted the application for National Defence Academy Examination on 24th June, 1992. The acknowledgement card relating to the application submitted for National Defence Academy Examination was proved as Ex.PW1/7. PW-1 further deposed that upon successful passing of the National Defence Academy Examination, the deceased would have been appointed as Second Lieutenant in defence services at a salary of `15,000/- per month and he would have retired from the defence services as Lieutenant Colonel with a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. The father of the deceased was aged 49 years and the mother of the deceased was aged 42 years at the time of the accident. The father of the deceased had retired from Indian Army on 1 st October, 1990 as Subedar Major. The record of his pension was proved as Ex.PW1/8.
4. The Claims Tribunal assumed the income of the deceased as `5,000/- per month, deducted 1/4th towards his personal expenses and applied the multiplier of 10 to compute the loss of dependency at `4,50,000/-. The Claims Tribunal awarded `1,00,000/- towards loss of love and affection and `25,000/- towards funeral expenses. The total compensation awarded is `5,75,000/-.
5. The learned counsel for the appellant has urged following grounds at the time of hearing of this appeal:-
(i) The income of the deceased be taken as `1,800/- per month.
(ii) The multiplier be reduced from 10 to 9.
(iii) The personal expenses of the deceased be reduced from 1/4th to 1/2.
(iv) The compensation for loss of love and affection be reduced from `1,00,000/- to `10,000/-.

(iii) The compensation be awarded for loss of estate.
7. In Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy & Ors. v. UOI, 104 (2003) DLT 234 (DB), the Division Bench of this Court applied the multiplier method and the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to compute the compensation payable to the victims of the Uphaar Tragedy. The Division Bench held that the victims of the fire incident belonged to reasonably well-placed families and presumed that the average income of the victims above age of 20 years to be not less than `15,000/- per month, 1/3rd was deducted towards the personal expenses and the multiplier of 15 was applied to compute the compensation as `18,00,000/-. With respect to the children, the Division Bench awarded compensation of `15,00,000/-. The Division Bench also awarded interest @ 9% per annum. The findings of the Division Bench of this Court are reproduced hereunder :-
For victims aged more than 20 years:-
(`8,333/- less 1/3rd )x 12 x 15 = `10 lakhs. For victims aged less than 20 years:-
(`6249/- less 1/3rd ) x 15 = `7.5 lakhs.
10. It is relevant to note that the Uphaar Tragedy took place on 13th June, 1997 and the minimum wages at the relevant time ranged from `1677/- for unskilled workers to `2437/- for graduates. It is thus clear that although there was no proof of the income of the victims, the Supreme Court did not find it proper to apply the minimum wages.
11. In United India Insurance Co. v. Kanwar Lal, MAC.APP.No.385/2007 decided on 27th April, 2012, this Court following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra) awarded `10 lakhs in respect of the death of an eighteen year old child. The findings of this Court are reproduced hereunder :-
12. In National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh, MAC.APP.No.311/2005, decided on 1st May, 2012, this Court following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra) and of this Court in United India Insurance Co. v. Kanwar Lal (supra) awarded `9,35,200/- in respect of the death of an eleven year old child. The findings of this Court are reproduced hereunder:-
13. In the present case, the deceased was a very bright student of 12th standard and had submitted an application for National Defence Academy (NDA) Examination on 24th June, 1992. The acknowledgment card of the said application has been proved as Ex.PW1/7. Upon successful passing of the said examination, the deceased would have joined the defence services as Second Lieutenant with a salary of `15,000/- per month and would have retired with a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. In United India Insurance Co. v. Kanwar Lal (supra), the deceased aged 18 years, was a student of XIIth standard and was ambitious to become MBA/C.A. whereas in National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh (supra), the deceased aged 11 years, was a student of Vth standard and was ambitious to become an engineer. In both the aforesaid cases, the ambition of the deceased had not taken shape and this Court assumed the income of `10,800/- following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra). However, in the present case, the deceased aged 17 years, was a brilliant student of XIIth standard and his ambition to join the defense services was taking shape as the deceased had applied for the NDA examination on 24th June, 1992 but his unfortunate accident snatched away his life before he could appear in the examination. The parents of the deceased successfully proved that upon selection in NDA examination, the deceased would have joined the defense services as Second Lieutenant at a salary of `15,000/- per month and would have retired as Lieutenant Colonel at a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. In view of the clear evidence on record, it is safe to draw a presumption that the deceased would have earned atleast `15,000/- per month. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra) and of this Court in United India Insurance Company Limited v. Kanwar Lal (supra) and National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh (supra), the income of the deceased is taken to be `15,000/- per month.
14. The deceased was unmarried at the time of the accident and, therefore, the appropriate deduction towards personal expenses is 1/2 whereas Claims Tribunal has deducted 1/4th towards personal expenses. The personal expenses of the deceased are reduced from 1/4th to 1/2.
15. The parents of the deceased were aged 42 years and 49 years at the time of accident. The appropriate multiplier according to the age of the mother of the deceased is 14 whereas the Claims Tribunal has applied the multiplier of 10. The multiplier is, therefore, enhanced from 10 to 14.
16. The Claims Tribunal has awarded `1,00,000/- towards loss of love and affection which is not warranted in the facts of this case. The compensation for loss of love and affection is reduced from `1,00,000/- to `10,000/-.
17. The Claims Tribunal has not awarded any compensation for loss of estate. `10,000/- is awarded towards loss of estate.
18. The compensation of `25,000/- awarded by the Claims Tribunal towards the funeral expenses does not warrant any interference.
19. The Claims Tribunal has awarded interest at the rate of 9% per annum, which is reasonable in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in MCD v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra) in which interest at the rate of 9% per annum has been awarded.
20. Taking the income of the deceased as `15,000/-, deducting 1/2 towards personal expenses and applying the multiplier of 14, the loss of dependency is computed to `12,60,000/-. The claimants/respondents No.1 and 2 are entitled to a total compensation of `13,05,000/- as per the break up given hereunder:-

21. The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the award amount cannot be enhanced as the claimants have not filed the cross-objections. The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is contrary to the law. It is well settled that Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Appellate Court to grant relief to a person who has neither appealed nor filed any cross-objections. The object of this provision is to do complete justice between the parties. The following judgments of the Supreme Court may be referred to in this regard:-
(i) Pannalal v. State of Bombay, AIR 1963 SC 1516.
(ii) Rameshwar Prasad v. M/s Shyam Beharilal Jagannath, (1964) 3 SCR 549.
(iii) Nirmal Bala Ghose v. Balai Chand Ghose, AIR 1965 SC 1874.
(iv) Giasi Ram v. Ramjilal, AIR 1969 SC 1144.
(v) Harihar Prasad Singh v. Balmiki Prasad Singh, (1975) 2 SCR 932.
(vi) Mahant Dhangir v. Madan Mohan, (1988) 1 SCR 679.
(vii) State of Punjab v. Bakshish Singh, (1999) 8 SCC 222.
22. Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 empowers the Court to award such compensation as appears to be just which has been interpreted to mean just in accordance with law and it can be more than the amount claimed by the claimants. The provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 are clearly a beneficial legislation and hence should be interpreted in a way to enable the Court to assess just compensation. The scope of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the power of the High Court to enhance the award amount in accident cases in the absence of cross- objections has been discussed by the Supreme Court in Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh, AIR 2003 SC 674 where the Apex Court has held that the Court is required to determine just compensation and there is no other limitation or restriction for awarding such compensation and in appropriate cases wherefrom the evidence brought on record if the Tribunal/Court considers that the claimant is entitled to get more compensation than claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award and would empower the Court to enhance the compensation at the appellate stage even without the injured filing an appeal or cross-objections.
23. The scope of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure in motor accident cases has been exhaustively discussed in the following three High Court judgments:-
(i) In National Insurance Company v. Rani, 2006 ACJ 1224, the Division Bench of Madras High Court held as under:-
(ii) In Oriental Fire And General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Amarsing Pratapsing Sikliker, I (1993) ACC 627, the Division Bench of Gujarat High held as under:-
(iii) In Prakramchand v. Chuttan, AIR 1991 MP 280, the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court held as under:-
24. The appellant is claiming recovery rights to recover the award amount from the owner of the offending vehicle on the ground that the driving licence of the driver was fake. However, the Claims Tribunal had declined to grant the recovery rights as the owner of the offending vehicle has appeared in the witness box as R3W2 and deposed that he had checked the driving licence of the driver at the time of appointment and believed it to be genuine. No evidence has been led by the appellant to prove that the violation of the policy was willful and deliberate, which is necessary to prove to grant recover rights.
25. The law on the subject of fake driving licence is well settled by the judgment of three Judges Bench of the Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Limited v. Swaran Singh, (2004) 3 SCC 297 wherein the Court held as under:-
26. The finding of the Claims Tribunal is squarely covered by the aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court. There is no evidence to show that the insured was aware of the fact that the driving licence of the driver was fake. On the other hand, the owner has deposed on oath before the Claims Tribunal that she had checked the driving licence of the driver at the time of the appointment and believed it to be genuine. In that view of the matter, the appellant is not entitled to recovery rights in the present case.
27. For the reasons as aforesaid, the appeal is partly allowed. However, the award amount is enhanced from `5,75,000/- to `13,05,000/- along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the filing the claim petition till realization.
28. The appellant has deposited a sum of `3,35,000/- with the Claims Tribunal in terms of the order dated 20th May, 2009.
