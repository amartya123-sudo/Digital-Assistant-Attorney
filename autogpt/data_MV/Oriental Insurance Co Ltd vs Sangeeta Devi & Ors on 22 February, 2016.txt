Delhi High Court
Oriental Insurance Co Ltd vs Sangeeta Devi & Ors on 22 February, 2016
Author: R. K. Gauba
R.K.GAUBA, J (ORAL):
1. Amarjeet Singh, aged 37 years, a driver by profession, died as a result of injuries suffered in a motor vehicular accident which took place on 02-05- 2009 in the area of Paschim Vihar, New Delhi. At the time of the accident, he was driving a two wheeler scooter bearing registration no. DL 4S AQ 8595, which was hit by truck bearing registration no. PB 23F 9897 (the offending vehicle) statedly driven in negligent manner by Kulwinder Singh (the sixth respondent herein), who is also its owner, it having concededly been insured against third party risk with the appellant insurance company (insurer) for the period in question. The dependent family members of Amarjeet Singh (first to fifth respondent herein) brought a claim petition under sections 166 and 140 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (MV Act) before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the tribunal) on 26-11-2009 whereupon it was registerd as suit no. 52/10 (2009). In the said claim case, the appellant insurance company was impleaded as a party/respondent (second respondent) in addition to Kulwinder Singh (driver-cum-owner).
2. The driver-cum-owner (sixth respondent in the appeal), upon being served with the notice of the tribunal, filed his written statement denying involvement of his vehicle in the accident and claiming that the deceased himself was responsible on account of careless driving. He also pleaded that he was also holding a valid and genuine driving licence and referred to the insurance policy to claim that he could not be held liable. The appellant/insurance company, on the other hand, when served with the notice of the tribunal filed written statement, inter-alia, claiming that its liability would be subject to proof being adduced that the driver of the offending vehicle was holding a valid and effective driving licence and that there was no violation of any conditions of the insurance policy.
3. The tribunal held inquiry in the course of which the claimants examined three witnesses including the first respondent Sangeeta Devi (PW-
1), Yudhvir Singh (PW-2) and Insan Ali (PW-3). Whilst the evidence of PW-3 was intended to prove the earnings from his employment as driver, PW-2 was produced as an eye witness to the occurrence to prove negligence on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle. PW-1 examined herself to prove the status, relation and the background facts relevant for calculating the compensation payable. No evidence was adduced by any of the respondents.
4. On conclusion of the inquiry, the tribunal, by judgment dated 22-11- 2010, awarded compensation in the sum of ` 11 lacs with interest payable at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization. The apportionment of the compensation, thus awarded, was subjected to some modifications by a subsequent order dated 06-01-2011. The driver-cum-owner having been held liable to pay the compensation, the appellant company was directed to indemnify.
5. The insurance company has come up in appeal basically to question the quantum of compensation. The counsel for the claimants, however, raised preliminary objection that since the insurance policy was admitted and no proof of any of the defences available under section 149 of MV Act had been adduced nor any formal permission taken in terms of section 170 of MV Act, the insurance company could not be permitted to agitate any contentions having a bearing on the computation of compensation. In this context, he placed reliance on Shankarayya & Anr. Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and another 1998 (3) SCC 140; Rita Devi Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2000) 5 SCC113; Chinnama George & Ors. Vs. N.K. Raju & Another (2000) 4 SCC 130 and National Insurance Co. Ltd. Chandigarh Vs. Nicolleta Rohtagi & Ors. (2002) 7 SCC 456.
6. On the other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the insurance company, on the strength of United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shila Datta & Ors. (2011) 10 SCC 509, that it having been impleaded as a party respondent by the claimants in the claim case, the contest with regard to the computation of compensation, if it is found to be excessive, arbitrary or erroneous, can always be raised by it.
7. Per contra, the counsel for the claimants argued that since the view taken in Shankarayya (supra) by a bench of two Hon‟ble Judges of the Supreme Court had been affirmed in the case of Nicolleta Rohtagi (supra), by a bench of three Hon‟ble Judges, it was not open to the coordinate bench of three Hon‟ble Judges in the case of Shila Datta (supra) to take a contrary view on the issue and, thus, the law laid down in Nicoletta Rohtagi (supra) would prevail which, according to him, is the view taken by the other benches of the Supreme Court in Josphine James Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. 2013 (139) DRJ 24 SC and Rekha Jain Vs. National Insurance Co. AIR 2013 SC 3429.
8. In view of the issues raised in this appeal, the other counsel representing various insurance companies were also requested to assist. Mr. A.K. Soni, Advocate also made submissions in addition to Mr. L.K. Tyagi, Advocate on behalf of insurance companies.
9. As argued by the learned counsel for the claimants himself, the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court including the ones reported as Shankarayya (supra), Rita Devi (supra) and Chinnama George (supra) on the issue raised here were duly noted by the Supreme Court in Nicoletta Rohtagi (supra). Certain observations of the Supreme Court in Nicoletta Rohtagi (supra), appearing in paras 18, 31 and 32 only need to be noted here. They read as under:
10. It is clear from the above observations that the insurer can seek to be impleaded as a party in case there are statutory defences available to it in terms of section 149 of the MV Act or if there is a collusion between the claimant and the insured or if the insured fails to contest the claim. In this context, the conditions precedent specified in section 170 of MV Act are to be satisfied. The insurer has no right of its own to challenge the award on merits including by way of appeal under section 173. But once it is impleaded as a party, whether on account of collusion between the claimant and the insured or on account of the insured failing to contest, even if on directions suo motu issued by the tribunal, it is open to the insurer to contest on all the grounds which would be available to the insured or the persons against whom claim is made. In (para 18 of) the judgment in Nicolleta Rohtagi (supra) it was made clear that upon being made a party, the insurer shall have all defences available to it.
11. In Shila Datta (supra), the matter had come up before a bench of three Hon‟ble Judges of the Supreme Court upon a reference made for examination of the correctness of the decision in Nicolleta Rohtagi (supra). Though the two questions referred to the larger bench revolved around the permissibility of contest by the insurer to the claim on merits, particularly in regard to the quantum and the right to appeal under section 173 of MV Act so as to question the quantum of compensation awarded at its expense, the larger bench decided to examine the matter along the following lines:-
12. The court noted at the end of para 12 that the issues nos. (i) and (ii), as delineated above, had not arisen for consideration nor were considered in Nocolleta Rohtagi (supra). On point no. (i), which concerns the "position in cases where the claimants implead the insurer as a respondent in the claim petition", the court took the following view:
14. On the other point taken up for consideration, the bench of three Hon‟ble Judges of the Supreme Court in Shila Datta (supra) held the view which is in conflict with Nicolleta Rohtagi (supra) and, thus, recommended that the same be referred to a larger bench. On the first issue, with which the present case is concerned, the court authoritatively held that the insurance company having been impleaded as a party respondent, as contrasted by a case where it may be only a noticee, it can defend the claim on all grounds as may be available to other party - respondent.
15. A bench of three Hon‟ble Judges of the Supreme Court in a batach of several similarly placed matters led by United India Insurance Company Vs. Sudha Rani bearing Civil Appeal no. 8654/13 decided on 24-09-2013 had set aside the order of a learned single judge of this court rejecting the appeal of the insurance company questioning the computation of compensation for reasons identical to those being urged by the claimants in the matter at hand, holding that in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Shila Datta (supra), the said issues were not res integra.
16. In above facts and circumstances, it cannot be said, as is being contended, that the view taken in Shila Datta (supra) cannot hold the field or that on the basis of ratio in Nicolleta Rohtagi (supra) the appeal of the insurance company ought to be held to be not maintainable.
17. Since the appellant insurance company was party - respondent to the claim petition before the tribunal it not only was entitled to raise all defences available to other respondents but may also bring in challenge to the decision of the tribunal in exercise of remedy of appeal under section 173 of MV Act.
18. The preliminary objection to the maintainability of the appeal of the insurance company having been repelled, as above, its contentions on merits are taken up.
19. It was argued by the counsel for the insurance company that the computation of compensation by adding the element of future prospects to the extent of 50% was incorrect. In this context, the following state of law needs to be kept in mind.
20. In the case reported as Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121, Supreme Court, inter-alia, ruled that the element of future prospects of increase in income will not be granted in cases where the deceased was "self employed" or was working on a "fixed salary". Though this view was affirmed by a bench of three Hon‟ble Judges in Reshma Kumari & Ors. Vs. Madan Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 65, on account of divergence of views, as arising from the ruling in Rajesh & Ors. vs. Rajbir & Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 54, the issue was later referred to a larger bench, inter-alia, by order dated 02.07.2014 in National Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Pushpa & Ors., (2015) 9 SCC166.
21. Against the above backdrop, by judgment dated 22.01.2016 passed in MAC Appeal No. 956/2012 (Sunil Kumar v. Pyar Mohd.), this Court has found it proper to follow the view taken earlier by a learned single judge in MAC Appeal No. 189/2014 (HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Lalta Devi & Ors.) decided on 12.1.2015, presently taking the decision in Reshma Kumari (Supra) as the binding precedent, till such time the law on the subject of future prospects for those who are "self-employed" or engaged in gainful employment at a "fixed salary" is clarified by a larger bench of the Supreme Court. This applies to the matter at hand because the claimant here pleaded about gainful employment at a fixed salary and has not led any evidence showing the salary was subject to any periodic increase.
22. Though the claimants had examined PW-3 in an effort to prove that the deceased was in regular employment, in absence of records of such employment including salary register, attendance register, etc, the oral word of PW-3 was not believed. The tribunal instead decided to adopt the minimum wages (` 4,358/- per month) payable to a skilled worker as the bench mark. In absence of proof that the income of the deceased was subject to any progressive increase, the factor of future prospects could not have been added. Thus, the loss of dependency needs to be recomputed.
23. The number of dependents being five, personal and living expenses have been correctly discounted to the extent of one-fourth. Therefore, the loss of monthly dependency comes to (4,358 x ¾) ` 3,268.50 rounded off to ` 3,270/- on the multiplier of 15, the total loss of dependency comes to (3,270x12x15) ` 5,88,600 rounded off to ` 5,89,000/-.
24. It is noted, however, that the matter relating to non-pecuniary heads of damages has been vaguely dealt with by the tribunal by awarding a consolidated sum of ` 2,05,000/-. Following the view taken in Rajesh & Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 54 and Shashikala V. Gangalakshmamma (2015) 9 SCC 150, compensation in the sum of rupees one lac on account of loss of consortium and rupees one lac towards love & affection, ` 25,000/- towards loss of estate and ` 25,000/- towards funeral expenses must be awarded. Therefore, the total compensation awarded in the case is calculated as (` 5,89,000/- + ` 2,50,000/-) ` 8,39,000/-.
25. The award of compensation in the case is modified accordingly.
26. There is no reason why the awarded compensation should carry interest only at 7.5% per annum. It has been consistent view of Supreme Court in a series of cases that such award shall carry interest at 9% per annum. [Kaushnuma Begum vs New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2001) 2 SCC 9; Supe Dei vs National Insurance Co. Ltd. (2009) 4 SCC 513; Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi vs Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy and Ors. (2011) 14 SCC 481; Basappa vs T. Ramesh (2014) 10 SCC 789; Syed Sadiq etc. vs Divisional Manager, United India Ins. Company (2014) 2 SCC 735; Surti Gupta vs United India Insurance Company and Ors. 2015 (3) SCALE 795; Kumari Kiran vs Sajjan Singh (2015) 1 SCC 539]. Thus, the directions of the impugned award are modified to enhance the rate of interest to nine percent (9%) per annum.
27. The tribunal by the impugned judgment and the subsequent order dated 06-01-2011 apportioned the compensation by specifying the amounts payable to the claimants. This may not be a correct approach. It is directed that the widow (the first respondent/claimant) shall be entitled to sixty percent (60%) of the awarded amount whilst the other respondents/claimants shall get ten percent (10%) each of the awarded compensation with proportionate interest. The entire share of second and fifth respondent shall be put in Fixed Deposit Receipts in their respective names in a nationalized bank till the time they attain majority. Eighty percent (80%) of the award in favour of the first respondent shall be similarly put in Fixed Deposit Receipt in a nationalized bank in her name for a period of seven years with right to draw monthly interest.
28. By order dated 22-02-2011, the insurance company had been directed to deposit the entire awarded amount with upto date interest with the Registrar General of this court. By order dated 22-11-2011, 60% of the said awarded amount was allowed to be released in terms of the order of the tribunal. The Registrar General shall now calculate the amounts payable to the claimants in terms of the award modified as above and release the same to the respective claimants in terms of the directions given above. The balance deposited in excess of its liability shall be refunded to the insurance company with the statutory deposit, if made.
29. The appeal is disposed of in above terms.
