Delhi High Court
Shanawaz Khan vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi & ... on 9 September, 2014
Author: Badar Durrez Ahmed
1. In this writ petition, which has been filed in public interest, the petitioner prays for a direction to the respondents to stop the plying of e- rickshaws in the area falling under the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi as the said e-rickshaws have not been registered, they are not insured and do not have fitness certificates. A seemingly alternative prayer has been made that the e-rickshaws may not be allowed to carry more than 2 to 3 passengers in view of the safety of passengers.
2. Notice was issued on this petition on 11.09.2013. On the returnable date (i.e., 08.01.2014), the respondents were directed to file their counter affidavits within four weeks. On 19.02.2014, the predecessor bench (Pradeep Nandrajog and Jayant Nath JJ.) took note of the fact that the writ petition had raised issues of public concern pertaining to an alleged policy decision of the Government of NCT of Delhi (hereinafter referred to as „the Delhi Government‟) which apparently envisaged e-rickshaws not to be treated as motor vehicles under The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 or the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 or the Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993 (hereinafter referred to „the said Act‟, „the CMV Rules‟, and „the DMV Rules‟, respectively). The consequence of this would be that e-rickshaws would not require registration nor would they require compliance with the other rigours prescribed under the said Act and the said Rules in relation to motor vehicles. The said bench, however, observed that prima facie the „policy‟ had been introduced "without proper application of mind". The court noted that, despite issuance of notice on the petition on 11.09.2013, the counter affidavits had not been filed addressing the issues raised in the writ petition and directed the Delhi Government to file a response "to its policy permitting unregistered e-rickshaws to ply on roads in Delhi".
3. On the next date of hearing (19.03.2014), this court expressed its dismay on the conduct of the respondents in the following manner:-
4. On the same day (19.03.2014), the court had also allowed the impleadment application (CM No. 3777/2014) on behalf of the "Battery Rickshaw Welfare Association (Registered)" and the association was impleaded as respondent no. 4. On 31.03.2014, CM No. 4285/2014 which was another impleadment application was allowed and the "Delhi Rikshaw Owner/Driver Sangarsh Association" was added as respondent no. 5.
5. On 12.05.2014, a counter affidavit of one Smt Sangeeta Bansal, ADC (HCD), was filed on behalf of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The stand taken by the said respondent was that it "cannot regulate or take any action until e-rickshaws are designated as non-motorized vehicles by the Government of NCT of Delhi and appropriate legislation is enacted in this regard". This is evident from the following extract of the said affidavit:-
6. The Delhi Government filed its reply on 19.05.2014 supported by an affidavit of the same date of Shri Saumyaketu Mishra, Deputy Commissioner, Department of Transport, Government of NCT of Delhi. The provisions of section 2(28) of the said Act, Rules 2(u) and 126 of the CMV Rules were referred to in the said reply and then it was stated as under:-
7. From the reply filed by the Delhi Government it is evident that the Delhi Government (through a letter dated 30.08.2013 issued by the Additional Commissioner (Transport)) commissioned The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to conduct a study on electric cycle rickshaws in Delhi. TERI submitted its Final Report under Project Code 2013UD02 early this year. A copy of the TERI report is annexed as Annexure R-17 to the said reply of the Delhi Government. For our purposes, reference to the "executive summary" of the TERI report would suffice. It reads as under:-
12. After the filing of the said reply on behalf of the Delhi Government, the matter was taken up by the court on 21.05.2014 when the court directed the Chief Secretary, Government of NCT of Delhi to file an affidavit disclosing "as to under what circumstances e-rickshaws were allowed to ply in Delhi". The court also directed as under:-
13. On 18.07.2014, another reply was filed on behalf of the Delhi Government. This time, as directed by the court, it was supported by an affidavit of Shri S. K. Srivastava, Chief Secretary, Government of NCT of Delhi. The stand taken in the earlier reply to the effect that plying of e- rickshaws in Delhi was illegal, was reiterated. It was specifically stated in paragraph 2(v) that:-
14. Coming back to the 2nd reply filed on behalf of the Delhi Government, we find that it is further stated therein that all e-rickshaws are public service vehicles as defined in section 2(35) of the said Act. Paragraph 2(iv) of the said 2nd reply reads as under:-
With regard to the action taken by the Delhi Government, it was stated that a public notice was issued on 09.12.2012, inter alia, warning all manufacturers/dealers/operators selling e-rickshaws to stop their activities. The said public notice was as follows:-
It was further pointed out in the 2nd reply that the Transport Department of the Delhi Government sent letters dated 10.12.2012, 10.01.2013, 11.01.2013 and 16.01.2013 to the Delhi Traffic Police pointing out that operation of e- rickshaws is illegal and dangerous to public safety and requested the latter to take immediate action to stop the operation of e-rickshaws. On 08.02.2013, the then Chief Secretary (Shri D.M. Spolia) who, incidentally is the current Chief Secretary, wrote to the Commissioner of Police as under:-
15. On 08.02.2013 itself another public notice was issued declaring the operation of e-rickshaws without type approval or certification from competent agencies as illegal. It is then stated in the said 2 nd reply that even the Delhi traffic Police had started prosecuting e-rickshaws but the process was stalled because, by an order dated 05.02.2013, a learned Metropolitan Magistrate had ruled that e-rickshaws do not fall under the category of „motor vehicles‟ under the said Act. We may say at this juncture itself that this is not a correct interpretation of the court order dated 05.02.2013. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate was dealing with a specific case under Challan No: PTH-8-0030-13 where a person had been prosecuted for running a motor vehicle (battery operated rickshaw) without a valid registration certificate. The defence raised was that the battery operated rickshaw was not a „motor vehicle‟ since its maximum speed was 14.17 km/h (i.e., under 25 km/h) and its motor was of only 182 watts (i.e., less than 250 watts). It is in this backdrop that the learned Magistrate held that no offence was made out by holding as under:-
It is only in that particular case, as the prosecution was unable to produce evidence to show that the proviso (un-amended) was not applicable that the court held that the particular rickshaw in question could not be regarded as a motor vehicle requiring registration. It is wrong to infer from the said decision that the learned Magistrate had ruled that e-rickshaws do not as a class fall under the category of „motor vehicles‟. In any event, now, because of the amendment to Rule 2(u), e-rickshaws would clearly be motor vehicles under the said Act.
16. Anyhow, the 2nd reply on behalf of the Delhi Government goes on to state that the then Chief Minister wrote a letter on 06.04.2013 to the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways calling for amendments in the CMV Rules, 1989 in order to provide an adequate legal framework for permitting the plying of e-rickshaws. But, as we have seen, that did not happen. Instead, a new proviso to Rule 2(u) of the CMV Rules was substituted in place of the old one thereby shutting out any chance of an e- rickshaw of being taken out of the purview of a „motor vehicle‟. The stand of the Delhi Government is summed up in paragraph 13 of the preliminary submissions in the said 2nd reply in the following manner:-
17. On 28.07.2014, an affidavit was filed on behalf of Delhi Traffic Police. The affidavit was of Shri R.K. Jha, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic (HQ), Delhi. In the affidavit it is stated that the operation of e- rickshaws needs to be regulated and their unregulated operation is causing a nuisance on the roads. It is also stated that a large number of e-rickshaws are operating all over Delhi without registration and are being driven by persons who do not have driver‟s licenses. Nor are the drivers subjected to any background verification which is mandatory for drivers of all other public service vehicles operating in the state. It is also stated that a large number of e-rickshaws are functioning as a feeder service for metro stations and their unregulated traffic tends to cause traffic problems. Interestingly, it is stated in the affidavit that "in the absence of any relevant provision in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the police is unable to prosecute them under the MVAct". This statement is not at all correct. Once an e-rickshaw is recognized as a „motor vehicle‟ under the said Act, then all the provisions applicable to motor vehicles such as the requirement of registration, insurance etc., would equally apply to e-rickshaws. This statement on the part of the Delhi Traffic Police is a very feeble attempt at trying to wriggle out of its responsibilities. One more aspect of the said affidavit needs to be emphasized and that is with regard to traffic violations on the part of e- rickshaws. It is stated as under:-
18. At this stage of the pleadings, the matter was listed before us on 31.07.2014. We passed the following order:-
20. The review petition came up for hearing on 05.08.2014, when, for the first time, an appearance was made on behalf of the Union of India by Ms Pinky Anand, Additional Solicitor General. The Union of India was not a party in the matter. However, the learned ASG was heard on that date and on all subsequent dates when the writ petition and the said review petition were taken up. The Union of India supported the stand of the review petitioner (respondent no.4) and requested that till appropriate changes were made in the said Act by Parliament and by it (Central Government) in the CMV Rules, this court ought to permit the plying of e-rickshaws subject to guidelines and restrictions which this court may prescribe. Ms Anand submitted that as there were no provisions specifically dealing with e- rickshaws, this court had the power under article 226 of the constitution of India to prescribe guidelines enabling the plying of e-rickshaws in the interests of the "thousands" of families which depend on the plying of e- rickshaws for their sustenance.
21. Before we examine these submissions, it would be necessary to notice the spate of additional affidavits that were filed after 05.08.2014. The first was an affidavit dated 13.08.2014 of Shri R.K. Jha, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic (HQ), Delhi wherein he simply stated :-
This was followed by yet another "short affidavit" (the third) on behalf on the Delhi Government. This affidavit dated 16.08.2014 was of Dr Satbir Bedi, Principal Secretary-cum-Transport Commissioner, Government of NCT of Delhi. There is no mention of e-rickshaws in this affidavit. Only general statements with regard to grant of driving licenses and expediting the registration process have been made as under:-
The next affidavit is also dated 16.08.2014 and is that of Dharkat R. Luikang, Under Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, New Delhi on behalf of the Union of India. The relevant portions of the affidavit are as under:-
An affidavit dated 29.08.2014 was also filed on behalf of the North, South and East Delhi Municipal corporations. The relevant portion of the Affidavit reads as under:-
The last affidavit was filed on behalf of respondent no.4 on 29.08.2014 in court (though the affidavit is dated 19.08.2014). In order to cover the lacuna of lack of insurance cover in respect of e-rickshaws, respondent no.4 allegedly raised a corpus of Rs. 10 lakhs. The affidavit was in respect of this and the relevant portion reads as under:-
22. So, the position is clear. E-rickshaws are „motor vehicles‟ as defined under section 2(28) of the said Act. In fact, they are covered by the expressions "public service vehicle" and "transport vehicle" as contemplated under sections 2(35) and 2(47), respectively, of the said Act. These facts are admitted by all the parties. Once this is so, all the provisions of the said Act applicable to "motor vehicles" and "public service vehicles" would be applicable in respect of e-rickshaws also. It would be appropriate to point out some such provisions. Section 3 of the said Act prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle (which includes an e-rickshaw) in any public place "unless he holds an effective driving licence issued to him authorizing him to drive the vehicle". Section 39 stipulates that "no person shall drive any motor vehicle and no owner of a motor vehicle shall cause or permit the vehicle to be driven in any public place or in any other places unless the vehicle is registered..". Section 66 stipulates that "no owner of a motor vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passengers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a regional or state transport authority or any prescribed authority authorizing him the use of the vehicle in that place in the manner in which the vehicle is being used". Section 146 of the said Act prohibits a person from using, except as a passenger, or causing or allowing any other person to use, a motor vehicle in a public place, "unless there is in force in relation to the use of the vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, a policy of insurance" complying with the requirements of Chapter XI hereof.
23. Therefore, e-rickshaws have to registered; they need to have permits; they need to be covered by an appropriate policy of insurance; and they need to be driven by persons holding driving licences. This, we have seen, has not been happening. The e-rickshaws hitherto plying on the roads of Delhi were not registered, they did not have permits and did not have any insurance cover. The fund of Rs 10 lakhs said to be have been raised by respondent no.4 cannot take the place of the statutory requirement of an insurance cover. Their drivers also, by and large, did not possess driving licences. All in all, their plying on the roads in Delhi was and is unauthorized and illegal. A position, which the Delhi Government has clearly brought out in its first and second replies. The Union of India has also recognized this and, as their affidavit states, has evolved a broad framework of guidelines for making rules for e-rickshaws for the guidance of the two committees it has established, one, to recommend rules of construction, equipment and maintenance of e-rickshaws and the other to recommend rules of registration, control, insurance, offences, penalties and procedure in respect of e-rickshaws. Thus, as of now, the plying of e- rickshaws in their present state is illegal and prohibited by law.
24. Till the plying of e-rickshaws is made lawful by Parliament and the Central Government, the latter has urged us to permit the operation of e- rickshaws in Delhi to "mitigate extreme hardship to tens of thousands of e- rickshaw operators and their families and to mitigate hardships to lakhs of citizens of Delhi in terms of last mile connectivity". Can this court by a writ or direction under article 226 permit something which has been expressly prohibited by parliament and, more so, when none of the provisions of the said Act are under challenge? We think not. In some systems of jurisprudence there is a legal maxim which says - what is not prohibited, is permitted. But, there is no authority in law for the proposition that what is validly prohibited can be validly permitted by an order of the court. The validity of the said Act and the CMV Rules are not questioned, yet, we are called upon to overlook the valid prohibitions contained therein and permit the plying of e-rickshaws till such time Parliament and/or the Central Government legitimize it! Courts can certainly iron out the creases, sand- paper the rough surfaces and chisel the jagged ends in a legislation to arrive at the true intent of the legislature, which, in turn, is an embodiment of the will of the people. High Courts can also quash provisions of statutes and, indeed, entire statutes if they run contrary to the Constitution. But, a High Court cannot create a statute, much less, permit what is prohibited by a valid statutory provision. We are not creators of law but, the interpreters and guardians of law and the rule of law.
25. However, the learned ASG and Mr Kapoor appearing for the respondent no.4 were insistent that we do have the powers and for this reason certain guidelines were suggested and, it was contended that from time to time courts have been issuing guidelines where none existed to bridge the gap in the interests of justice. References were made to (1) Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan: (1997) 6 SCC 241; (2) Vineet Narain v. Union of India: AIR 1998 SC 889; (3) Nestle India Ltd v. Union of India: 201 (2013) DLT 245 (DB); (4) Consumer Education & Research Centre v.
Union of India: (1995) 3 SCC 42; (5) Manushi Sangthan, Delhi v. Govt. of Delhi: 2010 VII AD (Delhi) 353. The decisions in Vishaka (supra), Vineet Narain (supra) and Consumer Education (supra) are those of the Supreme Court. The powers of the Supreme Court in this area are different from those of the High Courts. Articles 141 and 142 of the Constitution stand testimony to this. The Vishaka (supra) guidelines were issued by the Supreme Court, in the absence of enacted law. Vineet Narain (supra) was also a case where Supreme Court acted to fill the vacuum till suitable legislation was enacted. So, too, in the case of Consumer Education (supra), where the Supreme Court gave appropriate directions to fill in the gaps in legislation in the interests of workers employed in asbestos industries. In the case before us, there is no vacuum or gaps to be filled or no absence of legislation: on the contrary there is a legislative prohibition. Nestle India (supra), which was a decision of this very bench, was a case of an entirely different genre: there were inconsistencies in contemporaneous enactments where, adherence to one statute meant violation of the other statute. This is certainly not the case here. And, Manushi Sangthan (supra) was a case concerning cycle rickshaws and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Cycle Rickshaw Bye-laws, 1960. First of all, that case was concerned with „non-motor vehicles‟ (which are not covered under the said Act), whereas the present case is one concerning „motor vehicles‟, which do fall under the said Act. Secondly, there is nothing in the said decision which would suggest that the court can permit something which is prohibited by a valid statute. So, none of these decisions come to the aid of the learned ASG or Mr Kapoor.
26. In sum, the plying of un-registered e-rickshaws is illegal as per the law as it exists today. We cannot anticipate the legislative changes that may be brought about or the alterations in the statutory rules that may be introduced in the future. That is for Parliament and the Central Government to consider and act upon. For the present, a mandamus can certainly be issued to ensure that what is prohibited by law is not permitted in action. Therefore, we confirm our direction given on 31.07.2014, that the respondents shall act in conformity with the said Act and CMV Rules and prevent the plying of unregistered e-rickshaws. The writ petition is allowed to this extent. There shall be no order as to costs.
