Punjab-Haryana High Court
Munni Ram vs Fakir Chand And Another on 5 October, 2009
Defendant No.1 is in second appeal aggrieved against the judgment and decree passed by the Courts below, whereby the plaintiff was declared owner of half share of truck bearing registration No. HR 47-4738.
The plaintiff has filed a suit for declaration alleging that defendant No.1 has purchased the aforesaid truck in partnership with him, but the truck was registered as owned by defendant No.1 exclusively. The plaintiff relies upon an affidavit dated 10.9.1996 allegedly executed by defendant No.1, wherein the defendant has admitted the contribution of the plaintiff in the purchase of said vehicle to the extent of half share and that both parties shall be owner of half share each. Both the Courts have relied upon the said affidavit to return a finding that the plaintiff is owner to the extent of half share in the said truck.
R.S.A.No.262 of 2007 [2] Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the truck is recorded to be in the ownership of the defendant alone as per the registration certificate, therefore, on the basis of affidavit dated 10.9.1996, the plaintiff cannot claim to be owner of the said truck to the extent of half share. It is also contended that sale and purchase of a motor vehicle cannot be regulated by way of such an affidavit produced by the plaintiff. Reliance is placed on the Division Bench of this Court in Vipin Kumar Sharma vs. Jagwant Kaur and others, 2005(3) PLR 454.
I do not find any merit in the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the appellant.
The sale of motor vehicle is governed by the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 (for short "the Goods Act") and not by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. In Vasantha Viswanathan and others vs. V.K. Elayalwar and others, (2001) 8 SCC 133, Supreme Court has interpreted Section 19 of the Goods Act. It was held that if there is a contract for sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. While considering Section 31 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (for short "MV Act 1939"), it was held that it prescribes the procedure for entering the factum of transfer in the registration certificate which is an act posterior to the transfer but the transfer of the vehicle would be governed by the provisions of Section 19 of the Goods Act. Similar is the judgment in Panna Lal vs. Chand Mal and others, AIR 1980 SC 871, when after considering section 31 of the MV Act, 1939, it was held that the statute casts an obligation on the transferee to report to the registering authority concerned regarding the transfer of the vehicle along with a certificate of R.S.A.No.262 of 2007 [3] registration and then get the registration transferred in his name but if the purchaser has not chosen to move the registering authority, he cannot be heard to say that he is entitled for refund of the purchase money or claim damages. It was the duty of the plaintiff to have applied to the registering authority under section 31 of the MV Act,1939 and got the registration transferred in his name.
Apart from the aforesaid judgments of the Supreme Court, the question as to whether the registered owner alone can be deemed to be owner of the vehicle has come up for consideration in many judgments under the MV Act, 1939 and under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short "MV Act" as well. The provisions of the two statutes are substantially same except that the definition of owner as it appears in Section 2(19) of the MV Act, 1939 is different with the definition of "owner" in section 2(30) of the MV Act. Though the definition of owner has been changed but the judgments enunciating the principle of transfer of moveable property has not undergone any change.
In Oriental Fire and General Insurance Company Limited vs. Vimal Roy, 1972 A.C.J. 314, a Division Bench of Delhi High Court held to the following effect:-

A Division Bench of Madras High Court in Hema Ramaswami vs. K.M. Valarence Panjani and others, 1981 ACJ 288 was seized of a case where the vehicle met with an accident after the transfer of ownership but before the same was registered with the Transport Authority. The Court held to the following effect:-

Similar is the judgment of Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court reported as Madineni Kondaiah and others etc vs. Yaseen Fatima and others etc., AIR 1986 Andhra Pradesh 62. The Full Bench has considered the Supreme Court judgment in Panna Lal's case (supra) and held to the following effect:-
provisions of the Act and held for transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, mutation of certificate was not necessary. Panna Lal did not move the authority under the Act by filing application under S.31 of the Act and for that reason he was not allowed to claim refund of purchase money. The discussion in the case shows a vehicle can be sold and purchased without following the procedure prescribed in S.31 of the Act. In other words, to make the purchase of a vehicle completed, it is not necessary a fresh certificate should be obtained by the transferee or certificate of the Vendor should be cancelled by the registering authority under the Act".
Within this Court in The New India Assurance Company Limited vs. M/s Jolly Engineers & Contractors (P) Limited, Amritsar and others, 1985(1) PLR 187, it was held that the change of ownership of a vehicle puts an end to the policy of insurance even if the original policy holder continues to be shown as the registered owner of the vehicle concerned. It was held that the endorsement of the transfer of a vehicle in the records of the registering authority was not a condition precedent to its transfer nor did it deal with the legality or authority of the transfer, which fell to be determined by other provisions of law. It was held that it was the real owner who was thus liable whether or not he was the registered owner of the vehicle too. It held to the following effect: -

Later, in Labh Singh vs. Smt. Sunehri Devi and others, AIR 1988 Punjab & Haryana 149, learned Single Judge of this Court relied upon Division Bench of Delhi High Court in Vimal Roy's case (supra) as well as Madras High Court in Hema Ramaswami vs. K.M. Valarence Panjani and others, 1981 ACJ 288 and held to the following effect:-
section (5) in lieu of any action that may be taken against him under section
177. Sub-section (5) contemplates that the State Government may prescribe different amount having regard to the period of delay on the part of the transferor or the transferee in reporting the fact of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle or of the other person in making the application under sub-section (2). It, thus, transpires that the ownership of a movable property R.S.A.No.262 of 2007 [10] is not dependent upon the entries in the registration certificate. For the delay in seeking mutation of change in the registration certificate, the transferor or the transferee, as the case may be, can be penalized and proceeded against in terms of Section 177 of the MV Act, 1988. Such default is again compoundable on payment of prescribed fee under sub-section (5) of Section 50 of the MV Act, but the ownership of the movable property is not dependent upon the registration certificate.
From the judgments aforesaid, it transpires that the act of transfer of owner in the registration certificate in terms of Section 31 of the MV Act, 1939 or in terms of Section 50 of the MV Act, 1988 is required to be performed by the transferee. If the transferee does not effect the ownership transferred in the registration certificate in his name, it may liable him for punishment in terms of Section 112 of the MV Act, 1939 and 177 of the MV Act, 1988 but the property in the vehicle will stand transferred in terms of Section 19 of the Goods Act, when it was intended, it being movable property.
A Division Bench of this Court in Vipin Kumar's case (supra) has relied upon decision of the Supreme Court in Dr. T.V. Jose vs. Chacko P.M. alias Thankachan, (2001) 8 SCC 748. In Dr. T.V. Jose's case (supra), the argument of learned counsel for the appellant, registered owner, that there can be transfer of title by payment of consideration and delivery of car was accepted. It was held to the following effect:-

The appellant was made liable to pay compensation, inter alia, for the reason that the transferee was not party either before the Tribunal or before the High Court and the insurance policy was taken in the name of the appellant even though after the date of transfer of the vehicle. To protect the interest of the third party, the appellant was made liable for the compensation by specifically observing that the Court has not gone into inter se liability between the registered owner and the transferee. The liberty was granted to the appellant to adopt appropriate proceedings against the transferee.
The judgment in Dr. T.V. Jose's case (supra) is in respect of the accident prior to the commencement of the MV Act. Under the MV Act, the interest of third parties are protected under its section 157 whereby with the transfer of the motor vehicle, the insurance policy is also deemed to be transferred. Under MV Act, 1939, the transfer of insurance policy was required to be accepted by the insurance company in terms of the procedure contemplated under section 103A of the said Act. Such provision also supports the view that transfer of the vehicle is not dependent upon the entries in the registration certificate.
The Division Bench has not considered the long line judgments of this Court as well as of the Supreme Court including the larger Bench judgment in Panna Lal's case (supra). The Bench of this Court referred to word 'owner' in section 168 of the Act and concluded that it is the registered owner of the vehicle in terms of Section 50 of the Act who is liable to satisfy the Award. But that definition in section 2 of the MV Act have to be read in the context in which it appears has escaped the notice of the Court.
R.S.A.No.262 of 2007 [12] Therefore, the said judgment is per incuriam.
Now coming to the facts of the present case, the defendant- appellant has admitted that both the parties have purchased the vehicle by contributing equal amount and are owner of the truck in equal shares. Therefore, though the registration of the vehicle is in the name of the appellant alone but the title of the movable property would vest with the plaintiff as well as entry in the registration certificate is not a condition precedent for ownership of the movable property.
In view of the above, I do not find any patent illegality or irregularity in the judgment and decree passed by the Courts below, which may give rise to any substantial question of law for consideration of this Court in second appeal.
Dismissed.
