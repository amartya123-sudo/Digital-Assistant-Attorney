Author: Ms. Balwinder Singh
1. Vide this judgment, I shall dispose of the present challan filed by the prosecution under DMVR 11.8/177, 11.3/177 and Section 66/192A of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as M.V. Act). The brief fact of the case as per prosecution are that on 06.02.2011 at about 11.25 am the accused Rajesh Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 Kumar Mishra was driving one vehicle (TSR) bearing No. DL­1RL­8936 at PVR, Saket. He was carrying two foreign national in his above mentioned vehicle. It is alleged against him that he charged Rs.60/­ more than the amount fixed by the pre­ paid booth from the above mentioned passengers for dropping them to their destination and when they refused to pay the same, he started misbehaving with them and also try to assault them with a wooden stick. After which on their complaint the challaning officer who was passing through that place after noticing the incident issued the present challan against the accused for the violation of DMVR 11.8/177, 11.3/177 and 66/192A of M.V. Act which is Ex.PW­1/A. The offending vehicle was also impounded U/s 207 of M.V. Act.
2. Since the offences were bailable, the accused/driver was admitted to bail on furnishing of bail bond and surety bond in a sum of Rs.10,000/­. The offending vehicle was also released on superdari on furnishing of Superdarinama in a sum of Rs.4,00,000/­.

3. Notice of accusation was served upon the accused/driver U/s 251 CrPC to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined four witnesses namely PW1 TI, HKC Insp. S.S. Gill, PW2 HC Sudhir, No.74T , PW3 HC Bharat Lal, No. 1236, Incharge PCR Eagle­51 and PW4 Manoj ,and also proved the challan which is Ex.PW­1/A.
PW1 Insp. S.S. Gill in his examination­in­chief deposed that on the day of incident i.e. 06.06.2011 at about 11.25 a.m. he was passing through PVR, Saket chowk and there he noticed that few people were gathered there and Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 one vehicle bearing No.DL­1RL­8936 was also standing there. On inquiry, he found that the accused driver Rajesh Kumar Mishra had caught haversack (bag) of one foreigner namely Robert. The wife of such passenger Robert was also present there. Both of them were U.S. National. On further inquiry, Robert/passenger told him that they hired auto rickshaw of the above mentioned accused from pre­paid booth, Paharganj side on New Delhi Railway Station and got issued one pre­paid slip for Saket from that pre­paid booth. Thereafter, when they entered the auto rickshaw of accused driver, he told them that pay Rs.60/­ more because the destination where you want to go is far away from Saket. PW1 further deposed that the passenger Robert also told him that TSR driver assaulted them with a wooden rod and also tried to snatch the pre­paid ticket from them. PW1 also deposed that thereafter he started writing the statement of passenger Robert and in the meanwhile he made a call for PCR. The place where the passengers wanted to go was about 200 yards ahead of Saket. PW1 also deposed that he also recovered and seized one wooden stick of about 3 ½ feet long from the vehicle of the accused and took the same in his possession vide a seizure memo. The statement of the passenger Robert which is Ex.PW­1/B, seizure memo of wooden stick which is Ex.PW­1/C and the pre­paid slip which is Ex.PW­1/D were attached with the challan. Thereafter, he issued the present challan against the accused driver which is Ex. PW­1/A bearing his signature at point A.
In his cross examination, PW1 deposed that it is incorrect that the accused driver signaled him by waiving his hand to stop at the place of offence and that one PCR Van was already there before the arrival of PW1 . He further deposed that he recovered one wooden rod from the TSR of the accused driver and it was lying behind the seat of the driver. Foreigner passenger told PW1 that accused has tried to hit him . There were about 15­20 people present when PW1 Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 arrived at the place of offence. PW1 requested them to join as a witness but they were refused since they were afraid of the accused driver. PW1 negated the suggestion of the Ld. Defence Counsel that it was accused driver who called the PCR at the place of offence. PW1 further deposed that the place i.e. Paryavaran Complex, Neb Sarai where the passengers wanted to go was around 200 metres away from the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued i.e. Saket and the accused driver had to just crossed the road to drop the passengers at their destination. In the end, PW1 negated the suggestion of Ld. Defence Counsel that the accused did not charged any extra money or that the distance between the place of offence and the actual destination of the passenger is 2 kilometre.
In his examination­in­chief, PW2 HC Sudhir Kumar deposed that on 06.02.2011 at about 11.30 a.m., the offending vehicle was parked at the place of offence. One PCR Van and PW1 was also present there alongwith two foreign passengers. He deposed that one wooden stick was recovered from the auto of the driver but he did not seen the incident of assault on the foreign passenger by the accused. The accused was having some dispute over fare amount with the foreign passengers.
In his cross examination, PW2 deposed that on the day of incident he was on patrolling duty and while doing his duty, he reached at the place of offence. PW1 and one PCR with its some police staff was already present there. The distance between the place of offence and the actual destination of the passengers was about 200­300 metres. PW2 further deposed that when he arrived at the place of offence, PW1 took his challan book and issued the present challan against the accused. Some public witnesses were present there but they did not joined the proceedings and made excuses for not joining. The dispute between the Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 accused and the foreign passengers was regarding overcharging and misbehaviour. PW1 tried to convince the accused driver that foreign passengers are our guest and we should not misbehave with them. In the end, PW2 negated the suggestion of Ld. Defence Counsel that he is deposing falsely in the present case.
In his examination­in­chief, PW­3 HC Bharat Lal deposed that on 06.02.2011, he received one PCR call and reached at the place of offence at about 11.30 a.m. and at that time PW1, accused driver, two foreign passengers and some people from public were present there. PW1 seized a wooden stick which was recovered from the TSR of the accused driver and he also recorded the statement of foreign passenger Robert Carlos.
In his cross examination, PW3 deposed that he did not informed about the incident to the police control room. He was present at the spot for about 10 minutes. He further deposed that he did not registered any criminal case against the accused driver as a criminal case is registered by the local police and not by the PCR.

In his examination­in­chief, PW­4 Manoj deposed that he do not remember the date, month and year when the present incident happened. However, on that day he was present at Saket and witnessed that the accused driver and the foreign passengers were present there. They had a pre­paid slip from New Delhi to Saket. However, the passengers asked the accused driver to take them to Neb Sarai to which the accused driver refused and stated that pre­paid slip is meant for Saket only.
After his examination­in­chief the Ld. APP for the state requested the court that he be allowed to cross­examine the PW4 since he has Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 become hostile. In his cross­examination by the Ld. APP for the State, PW4 submitted that it is wrong that the accused driver was charging extra money from the passengers and that it is also incorrect that all the facts were reduced into writing in the present challan and were explained to him or to the accused driver.
5. After the completion of Prosecution Evidence, the statement of accused driver U/s 313 CrPC was recorded. During the examination of accused U/s 313 CrPC, the entire incriminating evidence appearing against the accused was put to him and he was given an opportunity to explain the incriminating evidence appearing against him to which he submitted that he accepts the fact that he was driving the offending vehicle on the day of incident and that he was carrying two foreign passengers. However, he submitted that it is incorrect that he refused to drop the passengers at their destination as the pre­paid slip was only for dropping them to Saket and not for the Paryavaran Complex, Neb Sarai. He further submitted that it is incorrect that he assaulted any of the foreign passengers. With respect to the recovery of wooden stick from his TSR the accused driver submitted that he was carrying it since he did not have any jack in his TSR so he was carrying it for the purpose of using it in case of any emergency(like breakdown of machinery and puncture of tyre etc.).

6. After examination of accused/driver U/s 313 CrPC, he submitted that he do not wish to lead Defence Evidence. Thereafter, the matter was fixed for hearing of final arguments.

7. I have heard Ld. APP for the State as well as Ld. Defence Counsel at length and have carefully gone through the entire record and evidence and after Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 carefully perusing the same, I am giving my finding as per below:
In the present challan, the accused was challaned for the violations of DMVR 11.8/177, 11.3/177 and Section 66/192A of M.V. Act,1988.
Sec. 66 of The Motor Vehicle Act , 1988 provides that: Necessity for permits - (1) No owner of a motor vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passengers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a Regional or State Transport Authority or any prescribed authority authorising him the use of the vehicle in that place in the manner in which the vehicle is being used:

The penalty for violation of Section 66 is provided in Section 192A.
Sec.192A of The Motor Vehicle Act,1988 provides that : Using vehicle without permit - (1) Whoever drives a motor vehicle or causes or allows a motor vehicle to be used in contravention of the provisions of sub­section (1) of section 66 or in contravention of any condition of a permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle may be used shall be punishable for the first offence with a fine which may extend to five thousand rupees but shall not be less than two thousand rupees and for any subsequent offence with imprisonment which may extend to one year but shall not be less than three months or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees but shall not be less than five thousand rupees or with both:

Section 177 of The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 provides that: General provision for punishment of offences - Whoever Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 contravenes any provision of this Act or of any rule, regulation or notification made thereunder shall, if no penalty is provided for the offence be punishable for the first offence with fine which may extend to one hundred rupees, and for any second or subsequent offence with fine which may extend to three hundred rupees.
It is also important to go through some other important provisions for the better understanding of violation of provisions of Motor Vehicle Act as alleged to be committed by the accused. Therefore, we must understand the meaning of permit, a motor vehicle, a transport vehicle.
Section 2(31) of The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 defines "Permit"
"Permit" means a permit issued by a State or Regional Transport Authority or an authority prescribed in this behalf under this Act authorizing the use of a motor vehicle as a transport vehicle;
Section 2(28) of The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 defines "Motor Vehicle"

"Transport vehicle" means a public service vehicle, a good carriage, an educational institute bus or a private service vehicle.
8. Thus in order to prove the guilt of the accused and to sustain his conviction the prosecution is required to establish beyond reasonable doubts that:
1. The accused demanded extra money or overcharged the passengers or that he refused to drop the passengers at their destination as per the pre­paid slip or as per the meter reading of vehicle 2 . That the accused driver misbehaved with the passengers.
3. By overcharging and misbehaving with the passengers the accused driver violated the conditions of permit issued in favour of permit holder( As laid down by the State Transport Authorities).
To prove this, firstly Ld. APP for State has argued before the court that the main prosecution witnesses namely PW1 TI S.S. Gill, PW2 HC Sudhir Kumar and PW3 HC Bharat Lal have proved the challan on record and have correctly identified the accused. The prosecution witnesses have remained consistent in their testimonies. However, Ld. Counsel for the accused has pointed out that there are many inconsistencies and loopholes in the testimonies of all the prosecution witnesses which raises serious doubts as to the veracity of the prosecution story. Ld. Counsel for the accused has pointed out the following inconsistencies in the testimonies of Prosecution witnesses.
Firstly, he has argued before the court that as per the testimony of Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 PW1, he noticed the incident while he was passing through PVR, Saket at about 11.25 a.m. and on some inquiry from the people gathered at the spot, it came to his knowledge that the accused had caught the haversack (bag) of one of the passengers. Further the incident of assault on the passenger was also told to him by the passenger Robert Carlos. PW1 has further deposed in his testimony that he could not understand the language of the foreign passenger Robert Carlos therefore, he requested him to write on a paper what actually has happened. All these facts shows that PW1 did not witnessed the commission of any violation/offence and that only through inquiry, he came to know that some such incident has happened. The fact that the statement was himself written by the passenger which was not corroborated by any witness also casts a doubt about its authenticity and also raises a suspicion that the statement may be made with some malafide intention. PW1 has himself deposed that the pre­paid slip which was recovered and seized by him vide seizure memo which is Ex.PW­1/D is for dropping the passengers from New Delhi to Saket. PW1 has also deposed in his cross­examination that the place where the present challan was chalked out and the actual destination of the passengers are different places and the difference between two is about 200 metres as per PW1 (though the accused has stated the distance to be of about 2 kilometres). Even if, we believe PW1 then also the accused is at no fault as the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued and the actual destination where the passengers wanted to go are two different places, though the difference may be very little. Further, with respect to the allegation that the accused demanded Rs.60/­, PW1 has deposed that this thing was told to him by passenger Robert Carlos and it did not happened in his presence. Therefore, this allegation is also merely a hearsay and, accordingly, the accused cannot be said to have committed any wrong or offence by taking a stand and refusing to Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 drop the passengers to any other place than the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued.
Secondly, PW1 has also deposed that there were around 15­20 people present at the place of offence, however, none of them joined as a witness in the present case despite his repeated requests. This fact is also not reliable. Moreover, if it was the case then PW1 should have taken some legal action or should have issued some legal notices to those persons who were present at the spot and refused to join the proceedings in the present case. But even nothing of such sort was done in the present case. It is a rule of prudence that when the independent public witnesses are available at the spot they must be joined as public witnesses. In the case of non­joining of public witnesses even when they were available and no plausible explanation coming forth from the prosecution for the same, the case of the prosecution should be seen with reasonable circumspection as it would be unsafe to believe the story of prosecution in absence of the independent public witnesses. Similar views have been expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sanspal Singh Vs. State of Delhi, 1999, Cr.L.J 1a.
Thirdly, PW2 and PW3 has also deposed that they arrived at the place of offence after the commission of alleged violations by the accused driver. PW2 deposed that PW1 and PW3 were already present there before his arrival and soon after his arrival, PW1 demanded challan book and issued the present challan. PW2 has also submitted that there is some distance between the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued (i.e. Saket) and the place where the passenger actually wanted to go (Paryavaran complex). This fact also shows that the accused committed no violation by refusing to drop the passengers at paryavaran complex as the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued was Saket and the accused driver dropped the passengers at that place. Further, with respect to the allegation Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 that the accused demanded extra rupees from the passengers nothing has been deposed by either PW2 or PW3.
Fourthly, PW4 who entered the witness box to depose on behalf of the prosecution has also turned hostile and has deposed that the accused did not overcharged and the pre­paid slip was meant for Saket and the accused driver drop the passengers as per the pre­paid slip.
Fifthly, the Ld. Counsel for accused has argued before the court that none of the complainant passengers have appeared in the court to depose against the accused driver. Therefore, the testimony of all the three main prosecution witnesses is totally unreliable, untrustworthy, without any corroboration and particularly, in view of the testimony of PW4 and also in view of the fact that no public witness has been joined in the present case, it cannot be relied upon. The prosecution could not prove any of the allegation against the accused driver and accordingly, he must be acquitted of all the baseless and false charges levelled against him.
On the other hand, Ld. APP for the State has argued before the court that though it is correct that the complainant passengers did not appeared in the court for deposing against the accused driver but this fact itself does not throw away the case of prosecution. All the three main prosecution witnesses have remained consistent in their testimonies and have also correctly identified the accused. The reason for non­appearance of complainant passenger is only that they were foreign nationals and could not appear before this court as their correct address could not be found out despite many efforts. Further, the reason for non­ joining any public witness has also been properly explained by all the prosecution witnesses.
Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936
9. After hearing the submission of both the Ld. APP for the State as well as Ld. Defence Counsel, the court is of the opinion that all the inconsistencies pointed out by the Ld. Defence Counsel are very material. It is correct that many efforts were made for the appearance of the complainant passenger by the prosecution as well as through various services of the court also but the end reality is that the complainant passenger did not appeared in the court to substantiate their allegations against the accused and to tell the court actual scene of incident. The court cannot force anybody to fight for its right if that person himself is not willing for the enforcement of those rights and the court also can not help those who prefers to sleep over their rights than to fight for their enforcements. It is pertinent to mention here that the matter was lingering for completion of prosecution evidence for about two years only due to the non appearance of the complainant passenger. Therefore, keeping in view the nature of the offence and also that the accused was suffering unnecessarily due to the non appearance of complainant passenger, the court closed the prosecution evidence on 12.04.2013 and proceeded further with the matter and completed other proceedings.
Now, as far as the evidentiary value of the testimony of other prosecution witnesses which have deposed in the present case is concerned, the point raised by the Ld. Defence Counsel are very material. From the testimony of all the prosecution witnesses, one thing is very clear that none of them actually witness the commission of offence as alleged to be committed by the accused driver. All of them arrived at the place of offence after the happening of the incident. In the present case, the accused was mainly charged with two allegations i.e. firstly, overcharging and refusal to drop the passengers at their destination, and secondly, that he misbehaved with the passengers, and, both the above mentioned Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 act as per law amounts to violation of permit conditions (as laid down by State Transport Authority). If we examine the testimony of all the prosecution witnesses none of them deposed that they actually witnessed that the accused was assaulting the passengers. Further recovery of wooden stick from the auto rickshaw is also not very material as the reason for carrying the same has also been explained by the accused driver. Further, there is no witness to the effect that the accused actually used that wooden stick to assault the passengers. None of the prosecution witnesses deposed about any act or conduct on the part of accused driver which can show that he misbehaved with the passengers except the allegation that he did not drop the passengers at their destination i.e. Paryavaran Complex. Now, if we examine this allegation, then also, there is nothing deposed or on record against the accused driver. All the prosecution witnesses have admitted this fact that the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued i.e. Saket and the place where the passengers actually wanted to go i.e. Paryavaran Complex are two distinct places and they are at a distance of about 200­300 metres though the accused stated the distance to be of about 2 kilometres. Even if we believe that there was only a distance of 200­300 metres from the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued then also the accused cannot be made liable for violation of permit conditions by not dropping the passengers at the place of their choice as the accused dropped the passengers as per the pre­paid slip,and , therefore, if he refused to go beyond the place for which the pre­paid slip was issued, he was right in doing that.
10. Hence, after considering all the material on record, testimonies of both the prosecution witnesses and after hearing the arguments of both the sides, the court is of the opinion that the prosecution is not able to discharge its burden and could not prove it beyond reasonable doubts that the accused actually Vehicle No. : DL­1RL­8936 overcharged or misbehaved with the passengers, and, therefore, his conduct makes him liable for violation of permit condition. Hence , he is acquitted of all the charges levelled against him under DMVR 11.8/177, 11.3/177 & 66/192A of M.V. Act 1988 as the same could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Copy of this judgment be given free of cost to the accused. Pronounced in the open court. File be consigned to record room.
