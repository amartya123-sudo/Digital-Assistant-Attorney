It is stated that the deceased was a private tutor aged about 26 years and 6 months at the time of his death and earning Rs.4,000/- per month.

6. The learned Tribunal after considering the evidence of three witnesses examined by the claimants as well as documentary evidence which has been marked Ext. 1 to 15 in respect of issue no.

M.A. No. 196 of 2011
7. Mr. Arvind Kumar Lall, learned counsel for the appellants submits that though there is several ground in this appeal memo but the appellants confine their argument for enhancement of compensation amount on the following grounds and do not press the other grounds agitated in this appeal memo :-
(i) It is submitted that in view of the multiplier as mentioned in the second scheduled of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 prepared in terms of Section 163A of the M.V. Act, 1988 as it stood at the relevant time, the learned Tribunal ought to have allowed the multiplier of 18.
(ii) It is next submitted that in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of N. Jayasree & Ors. vs. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited in Civil Appeal No.6451 of 2021 [Arising out of SLP (C) No.14558 of 2019], decided on 25.10.2021[2022] Acci. C.R. 165 (S.C.), paragraph no.34 and 35 of which reads as under :-

Ltd. vs. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru reported in 2018 (4) JLJR 230 SC, paragraph nos.8.5 to 8.7 and 9 of which reads as under :-
and submits that both are the cases arising out of the claim application filed under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. It is submitted by Mr. Lall, that total sum of Rs.2,01,000/- ought to have been awarded to the claimants under the conventional heads that is Rs.16,500/- each for loss of estate and funeral expenses that is in total Rs.33,000/-, spousal consortium at the rate of Rs.40,000/-, in respect of M.A. No. 196 of 2011 son of the deceased who is the claimant no.2, Rs.44,000/- and filial consortium of Rs.40,000/- in respect of claimant nos.3 and 4 who are respectively the mother and father of the deceased. It is next submitted that the learned Tribunal erred by assessing the income of the deceased to be Rs.2,500/- and the same ought to have been assessed as Rs.4,000/- per month and the tribunal ought to have also added 40% of the said income towards future prospects in view of the principle of law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi & Others reported in, (2017) 16 SCC 680. It is next submitted by Mr. Lall, that the learned Tribunal erred by awarding interest from the date of award and the appellants have no laches in disposal of the appeal. Hence, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that the impugned award be modified accordingly.
8. Learned counsel for the respondent no.1 owner of the vehicle on the other hand defended the impugned award and submits that the learned Tribunal has rightly assessed the quantum of compensation but erred in giving the right to recover of the compensation amount to be paid by the insurance company from the respondent no.1 and for that the respondent no.1 has also filed M.A. No.231 of 2011. Hence, it is submitted that the award be modified by deleting the portion of the award regarding right to recovery given to the insurance company to recover the compensation amount given to the claimants from the respondent no.1.
9. Learned counsel for the respondent nos.3 to 5 defended the impugned award and submits that since this is an application filed M.A. No. 196 of 2011 under Section 163A of Motor Vehicle Act, 2001 as it stood in the statute at the relevant time under which even if the claimant is at fault, he can resort to section 163A of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. Hence, the principle of law settled in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi & Others (supra) or for that matter in the case of N. Jayasree & Ors. vs. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited (supra) and Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru (supra) in which the principles of law settled in respect of a petition filed under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 who were enunciated, are not applicable to an application of no fault liability filed under section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. In this respect, learned counsel for the insurance company also relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Sohwa Devi & Ors. vs. Ranjit Das & Anr. in M.A. No.148 of 2010 dated 28.06.2022, paragraph no. 6 of which reads as under :-

Any claim made under the Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 exempts the claimant from proving the negligence on the part of the offending vehicle. It is a settled principle of law that even if the claimant is at fault; he can resort to Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. The principle of law settled in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. PranaySethi& Others was in respect of a claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. So when the basis on which the dependents of a victim in case of death of the victim or the victim himself can be entitled to M.A. No. 196 of 2011 compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act are different from the requirements of section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,the principle of law settled by the court or a precedent in respect of an application under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act cannot be used as a strait jacket formula in respect of a petition under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act. Hence, this Court is of the considered view that the principle of law laid down in National Insurance Company Limited Vs. PranaySethi& Others (supra) regarding adding additional amount towards future prospects cannot as a general rule be applied in respect of an application filed under Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Similarly, since the Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has laid down in no uncertain manner that under general damages, funeral expenses of Rs.2,000/-, loss of consortium, if the beneficiary is spouse to be Rs.5,000/- and loss of estate to be Rs.5,000/-. So this Court is also of the considered view that the appellant-claimants are entitled to general damages of Rs.9,500/- only and not ₹ 70,000/-claimed by them.
So far as the interest is concerned as there is no material in the record to suggest that there was any laches on the part of the claimants in delay in disposal of the claim petition nor any reason has been assigned by the learned tribunal, as to why it awarded interest from the date of judgment instead of from the date of filing of the claim petition, this Court is of the considered view that the claimants are entitled to interest from the date of filing of the claim petition. In view of the second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as the deceased was aged 30 years, the multiplier 17 ought to have been applied by the learned tribunal. Now as the monthly income of the deceased has been, both claimed by the claimants and assessed by the learned tribunal to be Rs.3,000/-, his annual income comes to Rs.36,000/-. Deducting 1/3rd of the same as personal expenses of the deceased, the remaining amount is Rs.24,000/- per annum. By applying the multiplier 17, the total amount comes to Rs.4,08,000/-. Besides, the claimants are entitled to Rs.9,500/- as per second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 as it existed in the Statute Books at the relevant point of time of Rs.9,500/- to be under the general payment. So total amount comes out to Rs.4,17,500/-. Since, it is a petition under Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the learned tribunal certainly erred by deducting 50% of the compensation amount on the contributory negligence on the part of the offending truck as there is no evidence in the record to suggest that there was any contributory negligence M.A. No. 196 of 2011 and further as negligence is not a sine qua non for filing an application under Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Hence, the claimants are entitled to receive Rs.4,17,500/- along with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment, for which the opposite party nos. 1 & 2 are jointly and separately liable. The sole point for determination is answered accordingly.
10. It is further submitted by Ms. Swati Shalini, that in SarlaVerma (SMT) And Others v. Delhi Transport Corporation And Another reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has found fault with the multiplier mentioned in the second scheduled of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 as it stood then. Hence, it is submitted that the learned Tribunal was proper in applying the multiplier 16.
11. Having heard the rival submissions made at the bar and after going through the materials in the record, the sole point for determination that crop up in this appeal for consideration is:-
'Whether the compensation amount payable to the appellants is to be enhanced?'
12. It is pertinent to mention here that the claim was made under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. As has already been held by this Court in the case of Sohwa Devi & Ors. vs. Ranjit Das & Anr. in M.A. No.148 of 2010 (supra), the purpose of legislation for introducing Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was as a beneficial piece of legislation. Any claim made under the Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 exempts the claimant from proving the negligence on the part of the offending vehicle. It is a settled principle of law that even if the claimant is at fault; he can resort to Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. The principle of law M.A. No. 196 of 2011 settled in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi & Others (supra) or for that matter in the case of N. Jayasree & Ors. vs. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited (supra) and Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru (supra) were in respect of a claim petitions under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. So when the basis on which the dependents of a victim in case of death of the victim or the victim himself can be entitled to compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act are different from the requirements of section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the principle of law settled by the court or a precedent in respect of an application under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act cannot be used as a strait jacket formula in respect of a petition under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act. Hence, this Court is of the considered view that the principles of law as enunciated in National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi & Others (supra) N. Jayasree & Ors. vs. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited (supra) and Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Nanu Ram @ Chuhru (supra) regarding adding additional amount towards future prospects in case of applications under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, cannot as a general rule be applied in respect of an application filed under Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 or for that purpose the compensation under filial consortium, spousal consortium, parental consortium or other conventional head under general damages cannot be applied to an application under Section 163A of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 because Section 163A of the Motor M.A. No. 196 of 2011 Vehicle Act has in no uncertain manner envisages that under funeral expenses Rs.2,000/-, loss of consortium, if the beneficiary is spouse Rs.5,000/- and loss of estate of Rs.5,000/-it is to be awarded. So this Court is also of the considered view that the appellant-claimants are entitled to general damages of Rs.9,500/- only and not ₹2,01,000/- claimed by them.
13. So far as the income is concerned, certainly the perusal of the record reveals that C.W.1- Gunjani Devi who is the wife of the deceased has stated that the deceased was a private tutor and was earning Rs.4,000/-. In her cross-examination, she has stated that she cannot say as to whom the deceased gave private tuition and how much her husband was getting from whom. C.W.2- Ranjit Kumar Paswan has also inter alia stated that the deceased was earning Rs.4,000/- per month. C.W.3- Mahendra Paswan in his examination in chief filed in shape of affidavit has also stated that the deceased was earning Rs.4,000/- as a private tutor.
14. As the wife of the deceased could not say as to whom the deceased was giving tuition or how much the deceased was earning from which of his student and except the matriculation certificate, there is no other educational certificate of the deceased in the record, this Court is of the considered view that the monthly income of the deceased would be assessed as Rs.3,000/-. As undisputedly, the deceased was aged 26 ½ years as per the second schedule of Motor Vehicle Act, the Tribunal ought to have applied the multiplier 18. Now as the monthly income of the deceased has been assessed to be Rs.3000/- his annual income come out to Rs.36,000/-. Deducting 1/3rd M.A. No. 196 of 2011 of the same, his personal expenses of the same, the remaining amount comes out to Rs.24,000/- per annum. By applying the multiplier 18, the amount comes out to Rs.4,32,000/-. Besides this, the claimants are entitled to Rs.9,500/- as per the second schedule of the Motor Vehicle Act as it existed in the statute book on the relevant point of time, of Rs.9,500/- under general payment. So the total amount comes out to Rs.4,41,500/-. The sole point of determination is answered accordingly.
15. Perusal of the record reveals that there is no laches on the part of the claimants in delay in disposal of the claim petition. Hence, in view of settled principle of law that in the absence of any laches on the part of the claimants for delay of disposal of the claim application, the claimants are entitled to interest over the said amount at the rate of 6% from the date of filing of the claim application that is from 15.09.2006.
16. Since the respondent no.1 has filed a separate appeal being M.A. No.231 of 2011. Hence, this Court is not considering the same in this appeal and the said contention of the respondent no.1 will be considered in M.A. No.231 of 2011.
17. In view of the discussions made above, the impugned judgment and award is modified to the aforesaid extent as already indicated above.
18. In the result, this appeal is disposed of with the aforesaid modification.
19. Let a copy of this Judgment sent to the tribunal forthwith. Since M.A. No.231 of 2011 arising out of the same M.A. No. 196 of 2011 judgment and award is pending before this court, Lower Court Records be tagged with the case record of that appeal.
