Punjab-Haryana High Court
Libra Bus Service (P) Ltd vs State Of Punjab And Others on 17 August, 2022
[1]. Petitioner has preferred this writ petition for the issuance of an appropriate writ, order or direction especially in the nature of mandamus, directing the respondents to issue certificates of fitness of the vehicles as per Section 56 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, Rules 38 to 41 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, pursuant to the application dated 11.01.2022 and list submitted by the petitioner to respondent No.3. Respondent No.3 be also directed to convey the said certificates of fitness to respondent No.4 and the name of the petitioner be included in the timetable for the various routes. [2]. The grievance of the petitioner is that despite submission of application dated 11.01.2022 for the issuance 1 of 20 of certificates of fitness for 73 buses, the issue has been kept pending by respondent No.3, except two certificates issued in the month of May 2022 for no valid reasons. As a consequence of the aforesaid inaction, the petitioner has suffered losses and has been ousted from the timetable of the buses issued on 26.05.2022. Petitioner has 73 buses, which were plying through the State of Punjab. Motor vehicles tax could not be paid due to the financial difficulty during COVID- 19 and also on account of the fact that the respondent-State had levied tax on vehicles, permits of which had expired and had not been renewed. Respondent No.3 while exercising powers under Section 11-B (2) of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1924, fixed the payment of installments of dues in four installments vide order dated 17.12.2021. The installment of Rs.1,46,36,750/- per month was fixed with last date of depositing the installment on 20th day of every month. As per condition No.4 of the aforesaid letter, it has been recited that "if the Government exempts any tax due to Corona, then appropriate proceeding will be initiated accordingly." The fixation of installment was not corresponding to the tax levied for permits which had expired. The said issue was not considered and adjusted. The difference in the amount due has to be checked properly. Respondent No.3 vide order dated 21.12.2021 erroneously fixed installment of 2 of 20 Rs.1,45,93,100/- per month with last date of deposit as 27th day of the month. Condition No.4 of the letter reads as under:-
[3]. In compliance of the aforesaid letter, the petitioner had deposited first installment on 27.12.2021. Subsequently, the petitioner had written a letter to respondent No.3 on 03.01.2022 for adjusting the tax of the permits, which had expired.
[4]. In the light of payment of first installment, another letter was issued by the petitioner on 11.01.2022 for issuing certificate of fitness. On 11.01.2022, the petitioner was not in default of any motor vehicles tax. Respondents No.3 and 4 did not chose to issue necessary fitness certificate in order to enable the petitioner to earn livelihood. The matter was again taken up with the authorities on 25.01.2022. The aforesaid letter was in respect of miscalculation of installment. The renewal of permits were sought to be revoked vide order dated 03.03.2022 on account of non-payment of second installment. This issue was the subject matter of challenge in CWP No.5632 of 2022. The said writ petition was got dismissed as withdrawn on 06.04.2022 in order to enable the writ petitioner to assail the order by way of another writ petition by incorporating subsequent events. Thereafter, CWP 3 of 20 No.8074 of 2022 was filed, assailing the illegality and the said writ petition is still pending.
[5]. The bus operators have faced huge financial constraints. Respondent-Authority by considering the situation and in exercise of powers conferred under Section 13(2) of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1924, granted exemption from payment of penalty or interest for late payment of tax and arrears were ordered to be deposited during the period from 06.05.2022 to 05.08.2022. The aforesaid exemption was subsisting for the period and in lieu of the same, the petitioner was to make good the arrears of tax, but the buses of the petitioner were ousted from the time table on 26.05.2022, thereby disregarding the amnesty scheme, which was made applicable to the petitioner. [6]. The stand of the respondent-Authorities is that the issuance of certificate of fitness is dependent upon the payment of tax. Despite the aforesaid stand, 2 out of 73 buses at serial Nos.40 and 64 of the fleet detail from 01.01.2020 to 31.03.2022 have been granted fitness certificates in May, 2022. Petitioner has also submitted detailed representations dated 02.06.2022 and 08.06.2022 in this context. [7]. By way of filing the present writ petition, petitioner has raised the plea whether the petitioner can be granted fitness certificate on its application dated 11.01.2022 when the 4 of 20 petitioner was not in default on payment of motor vehicles tax after payment of first installment and the date of second installment was not due. Petitioner has also questioned the action of the respondent-State in insisting payment of motor vehicles tax as condition precedent for the issuance of fitness certificates for the buses. Whether fitness certificate can be refused its renewal when the Government itself had extended the time period for making payment of taxes from 06.05.2022 to 05.08.2022 without any interest and penalty by exercising the power under Section 13(3) of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1924.
[8]. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the fitness certificate of the motor vehicle is governed by the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, whereas payment of tax is governed by Punjab Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1924. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 nowhere provides for the issuance of fitness certificate subject to payment of tax. Section 56 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 governs the issuance of fitness certificate of transport vehicles, which reads as under:-
payment of taxes. Section 56 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for a fitness certificate in terms of Rules 38 to 41 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The said rules have been made under the power granted to the State under Section 65(2)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. For ready reference, Section 65(2)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is reproduced hereasunder:-
[10]. Under Section 65 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the State Government has been authorized to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Chapter other than the matters specified in Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles 8 of 20 Act, 1988 is in respect of power of Central Government to make rules.
[11]. Perusal of Section 65(2)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 would show that neither the rules provide for any motor vehicles tax clearance, nor the Form CFX provides for any such motor vehicles tax clearance. Rules 38 to 41 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 are reproduced hereasunder:-
[12]. Rule 40 of the aforesaid Rules provides for deferring the issue or renewal of a certificate of fitness 13 of 20 pending rectification of certain defects. List of defects has been duly provided in Form CFX, in which arrears of motor vehicles tax is not a defect.
[13]. Sections 64 and 65 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 bifurcate the subjects on which the rules can be framed by the Central Government or by the State Government. Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 was framed for tax clearance certificate to be submitted to the testing station. The said rule was framed while exercising the powers under Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Section 65 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 gives power to State Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Chapter other than the matters specified in Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
[14]. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner by referring to Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 submitted that the said rule cannot be made applicable in the State of Punjab as the same has not been adopted in view of powers granted under Section 65(2)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Even a perusal of Section 73 of the Central Motor vehicles Rules, 1989 would show that no authorized testing station shall accept an application for the grant or renewal of a certificate of fitness unless the same is accompanied by a tax clearance certificate in such form as may be specified by the 14 of 20 State Government from the Regional Transport Officer. The rules framed by the State Government i.e. Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 do not answer such a contingency of providing for any motor vehicles tax clearance in the absence of any such form for tax clearance certificate. In State Rules, the intention is clear not to have such requirement of tax clearance for the issuance of fitness certificate to a motor vehicle.
[15]. Learned Senior Counsel by referring to State motor vehicles rules of Madhya Pradesh in case titled Rajesh Kumar Miglani Vs. State of M.P, ILR (2017) MP 2671, motor vehicles rules of Uttar Pradesh in case CWP No.922 of 2022 titled Deepak Kumar Tewari Vs. State of UP and others and Kerala motor vehicles rules in case titled State of Kerala Vs. C.P. Varghese, 2017 SCC Online Kerala 10291 submitted that the requirement of tax clearance certificate is introduced only after incorporating the same within the respective States rules while acknowledging the power for framing such rules in compliance of Section 65(2)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1989. In State of Punjab, no such rule has been framed, requiring the tax clearance certificate as a condition precedent for the issuance of fitness certificate of motor vehicle. [16]. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that amnesty scheme granted for relaxation to all the bus 15 of 20 operators to pay the principal amount within the prescribed time frame till 05.08.2022 without any interest and penalty has not been honoured by the respondent-Authorities while ousting the buses of the petitioner from the timetable issued on 26.05.2022. The necessary time period in view of amnesty scheme was available to the petitioner till 05.08.2022 and therefore, the fitness certificate was not required. Two of the buses of the petitioner in fleet detail have been issued fitness certificates, thereby showing that the respondent-Authorities are adopting pick and choose policy as many other bus operators, who are also in default in payment of the tax are being allowed to ply their buses by granting fitness certificates without insisting upon payment of taxes.
[17]. On the other hand, learned State counsel submitted that Article 246 read with entry 35 enumerated in list III and entry 57 enumerated in list II of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India lay down that the Parliament as well as the State Legislature has competence to make laws with respect to the "mechanically propelled vehicles" i.e. motor vehicles. By referring to Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, learned State counsel submitted that if the State has not framed its rules, then the Central Rules would prevail and the said Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 provides for tax clearance certificate in such form as 16 of 20 may be prescribed by the State Government from the Regional Transport Officer. Even for applicability of Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, there has to be a tax clearance certificate in the form as may be specified by the State Government. There is no such specified form prescribed by the State Government for the purpose of tax clearance certificate. State Rules in terms of Rules 38 to 41 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and even CFX Form do not show any such existence of prescribed form. Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 does not cover the ambit of rules framed by the State Government for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Chapter other than the matters specified in Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Learned State counsel while incorporating Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 also placed reliance upon CWP No.26857 of 2021 titled The Jagdamba Cooperative Transport Society Ltd. and others Vs. State of Haryana decided on 23.02.2022, State of Kerarla Vs. C.P. Verghese case (supra), Deepak Kumar Tewari's case (supra) and R.K. Miglani's case (supra) and ultimately contended that Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 would answer the present situation and the payment of tax is the condition precedent for grant of fitness certificate of the motor vehicle.

17 of 20 [18]. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, I find that Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 was framed in exercise of powers under Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Bare reading of Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 would show that for acceptance of an application for the grant of renewal of a certificate of fitness, tax clearance certificate in such form as may be prescribed by the State Government from the Regional Transport Officer is required. If no such form is prescribed by the State rules then the aforesaid Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 will not answer the question. Moreover the Rule 73 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 being the outcome of Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is not covered under the ambit of Section 65 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the State rules have been framed in the matters, which are not specified under Section 64 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Since the State rules do not provide for any such form for any motor vehicle clearance, nor the Form CFX provides for the same, therefore, the requirement of the statute/rule as culled out by the Division Bench of this Court in The Jagdamba Cooperative Transport Society Ltd. and others case (supra) would apply. Rule 40 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for deferring the issue or renewal of a certificate of fitness pending the rectification of certain defects. The list of defects has been provided in Form 18 of 20 CFX and the arrears of Motor Vehicles tax is not an enlisted defect in the said list.
[19]. In view of aforesaid discussions with reference to rules and statute, I am of the considered opinion that the issuance of fitness certificate of a transport vehicle has no relation with the payment of tax. The non-payment of tax is a violation of tax law, for which remedial steps can be taken by the competent authority. In view of mandate of Section 56 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the prescribed authority is under statutory obligation to decide the fitness certificate of the vehicle and in case, the authorized testing station refused the fitness certificate to a vehicle, then it is bound to supply the owner of the vehicle reasons in writing for such a refusal. [20]. In the present writ petition, the petitioner has prayed for direction to issue certificates of fitness in view of Section 56 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and to further convey the same to respondent No.4 for necessary action. Petitioner has also prayed for including the petitioner in the timetable in the various routes.
[21]. In the light of aforesaid discussions, this Court deems it appropriate to direct the respondent-Authorities to issue certificates of fitness to the buses of the petitioner as per Section 56 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Rules 38 to 41 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and allow the 19 of 20 petitioner to operate their buses. Respondent-Authorities shall also fix equitable installments for arrears of vehicles tax so as to enable the petitioner to deposit the motor vehicles tax in accordance with law. Respondent-Authorities shall also consider the feasibility of extending the amnesty scheme dated 04.05.2022 on equitable consideration in accordance with law.
[22]. The present writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
