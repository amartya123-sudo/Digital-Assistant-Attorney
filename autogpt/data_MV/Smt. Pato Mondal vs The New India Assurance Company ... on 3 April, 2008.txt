Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)
Smt. Pato Mondal vs The New India Assurance Company ... on 3 April, 2008
Author: Bhaskar Bhattacharya
an affidavit in opposition to the said objection has been filed. The matter was ultimately heard at length and Ms. Rani Jethmalani argued on behalf of the writ petitioners and Mr. F. S. Nariman, the learned senior counsel, argued on behalf of the company.
The report consists of two parts, Part I dealing with cases of death and Part II dealing with cases of burn injury. In view of the indications in the order of this Court, referring the matter to Shri Chandrachud that in deciding the quantum of compensation, the principles evolved in Safiya Khatoon's case as well as two other cases of Andhra Pradesh High Court, in the report, the principles evolved in the aforesaid judgments have been analysed at the first instance. It has been held that the multiplier method having been consistently applied by the Supreme Court to decide the question of compensation in the cases arising out of Motor Vehicles Act, the said multiplier method has been adopted in the present case. In the report, even the view of British Law Commission has been extracted, which indicates : "the multiplier has been, remains and should continue to remain, the ordinary, the best and only method of assessing the value of a number of future annual sums." It has also been stated in the aforesaid report that though Lord Denning advocated the use of the annuity tables and the actuary's assistance in Hodges v. Harland and Wolff Limited (1965) 1 All ER1086, but the British Law Commission accepted the use and relevancy of the annuity tables in its Working Paper No.27 by observing : "The actuarial method of calculation, whether from expert evidence or from tables, continues to be technically relevant and technically admissible but its usefulness is confined, except perhaps in very unusual cases, to an ancillary means of checking a computation already made by the multiplier method." Even Kemp and Kemp on 'Quantum of Damages' after comparing the multipliers chosen by Judges from their experience found a close proximity between the said multiplier method and those arrived at from the annuity tables in the American Restatement of the Law of Torts. After a thorough analysis of the different methods of computation of the compensation to be paid to the dependants of the deceased and what are the different methods of computing loss of future earnings, Shri Chandrachud has come to the conclusion that the multiplier method is of universal application and is being accepted and adopted in India by Courts, including the Supreme Court and as such, it would be meet and proper to apply the said method for determining the quantum of compensation. The counsel, appearing for the claimants as well as the company also agreed before Shri Chandrachud that the decision should be based on the principles enunciated in the three judgments mentioned in the order of the Supreme Court as well as the cases relied upon in those judgments. Amongst the deceased, there were many housewives and they have been classified in two categories, one those, whose husbands were employees of the company and as such whose income is known, and others who were outsiders, whose husbands' income is not known at all. The deceased- housewives have been grouped into four, on the basis of their age and different multiplier has been applied on the basis of their age. Shri Chandrachud also has considered the income of the husbands of those housewives, who are employees of the company and then on that basis, has tried to determine the loss on the death of the wife and after applying them multiplier and determining the total amount of compensation, an addition of Rs.25,000/- has been made as a conventional figure and the total amount of compensation has been arrived at. So far as the employees of the Tata Iron and Steel Company are concerned who died in the tragedy, their annual income has been arrived at and thereafter 60% of the income has been held to be dependency and then, a multiplier has been applied and on finding out the total amount of compensation, a conventional amount of Rs.25,000/- has been added. So far as the children are concerned, in the absence of any material, a uniform amount has been fixed at Rupees 50,000/- to which again, a conventional figure of Rs.25,000/- has been added for determining the total amount of compensation payable. So far as the children above 10 years of age are concerned, the contribution of those children to their parents have been assessed at Rs.12,000/- per year, taking all imponderables into account and multiplier of 11 has been applied and the conventional amount of Rs.25,000/- has been added. Two of the children in the said age group, whose father did not claim any compensation as they were negotiating with the employer, for getting a piece of land and as such no compensation has been determined in their case. In the case of death of known employees of the company, the annual income has been arrived, and then taking into account the age of the deceased and finding the dependency at 60% of the annual income and then by application of different multipliers, the compensation has been arrived at. As stated earlier, a conventional compensation of Rs.25,000/- has been added in each case. While determining the compensation, the benefits already granted to the dependants of the deceased as well as to the injured persons or their relatives have not been taken into account in view of the specific orders of this Court dated 15th of December, 1993, though it would be a relevant consideration for us, while disposing of the matter finally. No interest however, has been granted, as the question of interest has been left for consideration of this Court. So far as the costs of the proceedings are concerned, this Court had directed the Tata Iron and Steel Company to bear the entire cost of the proceedings."
In our opinion, the observations of the Apex Court, in the said case of Lata Wadha (supra), in connection with the assessment of death of the children out of fire arising out of a function, cannot have any application to a case of death arising out of a motor accident. Such compensation is required to be assessed under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The said Act does not provide for different multipliers in case of victims aged up to 15, whereas Shri Chandrachud, in that case, applied different multipliers inconsistent with the ones mentioned in the Act. Similarly, the grant of compensation at the flat rate of Rs.75,000/- in case of death of a child below 10 years, as assessed by Shri Chandrachud, is not provided in the Act. Nor is there any provision for assessing the contribution of the children aged above 10 to be Rs.12,000/- per annum in the Act as followed by Shri Chandrachud. The Supreme Court, however, held that the figures arrived at by Shri Chandrachud were inadequate and accordingly, enhanced the compensation for the death of a child below the age of 10 to Rs.2 lakh and that of a child above 10 but below 15 to be Rs.4.1 lakh.
Therefore, even in the case of Lata Wadhwa (supra), the Apex Court granted more amount of compensation than the minimum amount of Rs.1,54,500/- by treating the notional income of the child to be Rs.15,000/- per annum as provided in the Act.

However, recently, a Two-Judges-Bench of the Supreme Court in two cases, viz. Kaushlya Devi vs. Karan Arora and others (AIR 2007 SC 1912) and Orinetal Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Syeed Ibrahim and others (AIR 2008 SC
103), while dealing with the cases of compensation under the Act for the death of two Children aged 14 years and 7 years, was of the view that the compensations of Rs.1 lakh and Rs. 51,500/- respectively, were just compensations within the meaning of the Act. In both the abovementioned decisions, the Bench principally made the following observations:-

"There are some aspects of human life which are capable of monetary measurement, but the totality of human life is like the beauty of sunrise or the splendor of the stars, beyond the reach of monetary tape-measure. The determination of damages for loss of human life is an extremely difficult task and it becomes all the more baffling when the deceased is a child and/or a non-earning person. The future of a child is uncertain. Where the deceased was a child, he was earning nothing but had a prospect to earn. The question of assessment of compensation, therefore, becomes stiffer. The figure of compensation in such cases involves a good deal of guesswork. In cases, where parents are claimants, relevant factor would be age of parents.
In case of the death of an infant, there may have been no actual pecuniary benefit derived by its parents during the child's life-time. But this will not necessarily bar the parent's claim and prospective loss will find a valid claim provided that the parents establish that they had a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit if the child had lived. This principle was laid down by the House of Lords in the famous case of Taff Vale Rly. v. Jenkins (1913) AC 1, and Lord Atkinson said thus:
".....all that is necessary is that a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit should be entertained by the person who sues. It is quite true that the existence of this expectation is an inference of fact - there must be a basis of fact from which the inference can reasonably be drawn; but I wish to express my emphatic dissent from the proposition that it is necessary that two of the facts without which the inference cannot be drawn are, first that the deceased earned money in the past, and, second, that he or she contributed to the support of the plaintiff. These are, no doubt, pregnant pieces of evidence, but they are only pieces of evidence; and the necessary inference can I think, be drawn from circumstances other than and different from them." (See Lata Wadhwa and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. (2001 (8) SCC 197)=1998 AIR SCW 3105.
This Court in Lata Wadhwa's case (supra) while computing compensation made distinction between deceased children falling within the age group of 5 to 10 years and age group of 10 to 15 years.
In cases of young children of tender age, in view of uncertainties abound, neither their income at the time of death nor the prospects of the future increase in their income nor chances of advancement of their career are capable of proper determination on estimated basis. The reason is that at such an early age, the uncertainties in regard to their academic pursuits, achievements in career and thereafter advancement in life are so many that nothing can be assumed with reasonable certainty. Therefore, neither the income of the deceased child is capable of assessment on estimated basis nor the financial loss suffered by the parents is capable of mathematical computation."
It, however, appears that the attention of the said Bench was not drawn to the earlier Three-Judges-Bench decision of the said Court in the case of U.P. State Road Transport Corporation (supra), relied upon by the Two-Judges-Bench in the case of Manju Devi and another (supra), where the same Court decided to take the notional income of Rs.15,000/- as the income of a non-earning child by following the Second Schedule. We have already pointed out that in the case of U.P. State Road Transport Corporation (supra), the Bench held that in case of death of a child, the age of applicant is also a decisive factor.
In view of the conflicting decisions of the Supreme Court on the question of grant of compensations in case death of a minor having no earning capacity arising out of a motor accident, this Court is bound to follow the rules of precedents laid down by the Apex Court.

In a recent decision of a Five-Judges-Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of Maharashtra reported in AIR 2005 SC 752 = 2005 AIR SCW 349, the Bench laid down the law in the following way:-


By applying the principles mentioned above to the facts of these cases, we are of the view that the Two-Judges-Bench decision in the cases of Kaushlya Devi vs. Karan Arora and others (AIR 2007 SC 1912) and Orinetal Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Syeed Ibrahim and others (AIR 2008 SC 103) cannot be said to be valid binding precedent as the said Bench did not take into consideration the effect of the earlier decisions in the cases of Manju Devi (supra) and U.P. State Road Transport Corporation (supra). We are, therefore, bound to follow the principle laid down in the case of Manju Devi (supra), to this extent that the notional income of Rs.15,000/- as provided in the Second Schedule of the Act must be taken to be the income of a non-earning child victim subject to the other guidelines given in the case of U.P. Road Transport Corporation.
In the Second Schedule of the Act itself, there is no separate multiplier for the victims aged between newborn and 15 years of age and the provision of the notional income is a creature of legislative mandate. Note 6 of the Schedule 2 has, in clear words, directed that in case the victim is found to have no income, the notional income of Rs.15,000/- should be taken to be his income for the purpose of assessment and for that reason, the Supreme Court in the case of Manju Devi (supra) held as follows:-

Kunhikuttan and others reported in AIR 1970 SC 376 and referred to in the case of U.P. State Road Transport Corporation) and in arriving at the figure of compensation, all other applicable directions given in the Second Schedule of the Act, such as deduction of one-third of the annual income, addition of funeral charges and loss of estate as specified therein should be followed. However, the mistakes pointed out in the table by the Apex Court in the case of U.P. Road Transport Corporation (supra) should not be followed.
However, there may be cases, where although the child-victim at the time of death had no income, yet, sufficient evidence is available to indicate that he was extraordinary brilliant or had a special talent in a subject which is rarely found in a child of his age and hence, a bright future was assured. Similarly, there may be instances, where the victim is a precious child having regard to peculiar status of his parents, they occupy in their life; there may also be cases, where the parents had invested huge amount of money for the upbringing of the victim or he was the only one to fall back upon in their old age and there is no chance of having another child.

In the proceedings under Section 166 of the Act relating to the death of a child of the abovementioned categories, the Tribunal is entitled to assess higher amount of compensation after taking into consideration those factors.
Applying the aforesaid principles to the four individual cases before us, we now proceed to dispose of those appeals in the following way.
In the case of Pato Mondal, the applicant was aged 45 years and thus, the Tribunal rightly followed the multiplier of 15 and arrived at the figure of Rs.1,54,000/-. However, as the applicant claimed Rs.1,00,000/- only in the application, the Tribunal reduced the same to Rs.1,00,000/-. In this Court, the applicant has made an application for amendment of the claim-application by enhancing the valuation to Rs.1,54,500/-. As pointed out by the Apex Court in the case of Nagappa vs. Gurudayal Singh and others reported in AIR 2003 SC 674, we allow such application as in our opinion, the Tribunal having found the said amount of Rs.1,54,500/- to be just and reasonable having regard to the provision contained in the Act, there is no reason to reduce such amount of compensation. However, the Tribunal, in this case, failed to exercise discretion in terms of Section 171 of the Act by not granting any amount of interest on the said amount from the date of filing the application till the actual deposit of the amount by the Insurance Company. The Insurance Company due to delayed disposal of the application has utilized the amount, which should have come in the hand of the claimant at least earlier, at the rate of interest given by the Nationalized Banks on the deposit for one year. We, therefore, direct the Insurance Company to pay interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of application till the deposit of the amount. The excess amount be paid within one month from today.

In the case of Purnima Tewari and another, a 13 years old boy died and his parents within the age limit of 45 years are the applicants. Therefore, the Tribunal erred in law in awarding compensation of Rs.1 lakh. It should be Rs.1,54,500/- by applying the multiplier of 15 with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of filing the claim-application till the date of deposit of the amount. The enhanced amount be deposited within a month from today and the same should be payable in the same manner as ordered in the original award.
In the case of Radhanath Mondal and others, a child aged 2 years and odd died and the claimants are his brothers and sisters as the parents of the victim also died. In such a situation, the Tribunal erred in law in assessing the compensation at Rs.50,000/-. We, thus, set aside the award and enhance the same to Rs.1,54,500/- with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of application till the date of deposit. The enhanced amount should be deposited within a month from today. The money should be paid to the claimants in the same way as ordered in the original award.

In the case of Utpal Dey and another, the parents have prayed for compensation for the death of their child aged 3 years. The Tribunal granted Rs.50,000/- as compensation. In view of our findings above, the claimants are entitled to get Rs.1,54,500/- with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of application till the date of deposit by the Insurance Company. The enhanced amount be deposited within a month from today. The award is modified to the extent indicated above.
F.M.A. No. 46 of 2008 With C.A.N. 6486 of 2007 New India Assurance Co. Ltd.
Versus Smt. Krishna Rani Saha @ Krishna Saha & Ors.
For the Appellant/Petitioner: Mr Parimal Kr. Pahari. For the Claimants/Respondents: Mr Santosh Kumar Das, Mrs Sucharita Paul.
Heard on: 19.03.2008.

This appeal was heard subsequent to the conclusion of hearing of the aforesaid four appeals but as the point involved herein is the same, we propose to decide this appeal along with the abovementioned four appeals.
By this appeal the Insurance Company has challenged the award passed by the Tribunal below by which the said Tribunal assessed the compensation in terms of Section 163A of the Act in case of a death of a minor aged 12 years at Rs.2,29,500/- in favour of the parents of the minor.

In assessing such amount, the Tribunal accepted the notional income of the minor to be Rs.15,000/- and multiplied the same by 15 and added Rs.4,450/- as funeral expenses and loss of estate. The Tribunal, as it appears from record, failed to deduct a sum of Rs.5,000/- as required under Note-6 to the Second Schedule before multiplying Rs.15,000/- with 15. Thus, the amount should be Rs.1,54,500/- and should carry interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of filing the application till the deposit of the amount by the appellant.

The appeal, thus, is allowed to the extent indicated above. The amount be deposited, if not, already deposited within a month from today. The money should be paid to the mother of the victim alone, she being the sole legal heir.
( Bhaskar Bhattacharya, J. ) I agree.
