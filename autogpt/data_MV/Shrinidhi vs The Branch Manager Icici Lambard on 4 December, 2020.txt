Karnataka High Court
Shrinidhi vs The Branch Manager Icici Lambard on 4 December, 2020
Author: Nataraj Rangaswamy
Though these appeals are listed for admission, they are taken up for final disposal with the consent of the learned counsel for the parties.

2. All these appeals are filed by the driver and owner of the school bus challenging the Judgment and Award passed by the Court of Senior Civil Judge and Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Channagiri ('Tribunal' for short) in MVC Nos.97/2012, 98/2012 to 105/2012, 107/2012 and 108/2012.

3. Appellant Nos.1 and 2, who are common in all these appeals, will henceforth be referred to as the 'driver' and 'owner' respectively of the offending bus involved in the accident. Respondent No.1, who is common in all these appeals, will henceforth be referred to as the 'insurer' and the respective respondent No.2 in these appeals will henceforth be referred to as the 'claimant'.
4. In all the claim petitions, claimants were students traveling in a school bus bearing registration No.KA-03-9276 (henceforth referred to as 'the offending vehicle') from their respective villages to the School situate at Kabbala village on 19.03.2012. At about 10:05 a.m. when the offending vehicle was proceeding between Kabbala and Doddaghatta village on Davanagere- Channagiri road, the driver of the offending vehicle drove it in a rash and negligent manner and since he could not control the bus / offending vehicle, it toppled on the right side of the road causing injuries to the claimants. All the claimants were shifted to C.G. Hospital, Davanagere, for treatment and that each one of them claimed that they had spent substantial sums of money for treatment. Hence, separate claim petitions were filed by each of them under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, claiming Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation.
5. The claim petitions were resisted by the owner, driver and insurer of the offending vehicle. The owner and driver filed common objections, whereas the insurer filed separate objections. The owner contended that at the time of the accident, a vehicle loaded with sugar cane protruding two to three feet on either side of the vehicle, approached the offending vehicle from the opposite direction. In order to avoid colliding with the on-coming vehicle, the driver of the offending vehicle steered it away and lost control. The owner contended that as a result, some injuries, which are simple in nature, were caused to the students / claimants and that they had attended the School after first aid.

6. In so far as the insurer is concerned, it contended that the seating capacity of the offending vehicle was 18 + 1 while at the time of the accident, about 30 to 40 students were traveling in the offending vehicle and therefore, it contended that the offending vehicle was carrying more than the permitted seating capacity and also it did not possess a Fitness Certificate.
7. The father of the respective claimant in MVC Nos.97 and 98 of 2012 was examined as PW.1, who marked Exs.P1 to P9; the father of the respective claimant in MVC Nos.100 and 108 of 2012 was examined as PW.2, who marked Exs.P10 to 15; the father of the claimant in MVC No.105/2012 was examined as PW.3, who marked Exs.P16 and P17; the mother of claimants in MVC Nos.102 and 103 of 2012 was examined as PW.4, who marked Exs.P18 to P22; the mother of the respective claimant in MVC Nos.99 and 101 of 2012 was examined as PW.5, who marked Exs.P23 to 26; the father of the claimant in MVC No.104/2012 was examined as PW.6, who marked Exs.P27 and P28 and the mother of the claimant in MVC No.107/2012 was examined as PW.7, who marked Exs.P29 and P30. The officer of the insurer was examined as RW.1 and he marked Exs.R1 to R3. The driver and owner of the offending vehicle were examined as RW.2 and RW.3 respectively and they marked Exs.R4 to R21.
8. The Tribunal considering the evidence on record, awarded the following amounts as global compensation to each of the claimants.
compensation is concerned, the Tribunal considering the evidence of RW.1, officer of the insurer of the offending vehicle, and Ex.R3(a), endorsement in R.C. book, held that the fitness certificate of the offending vehicle had expired on 20.12.2011 and after the accident, the fitness certificate was renewed with effect from 15.05.2012 to 14.05.2013. The Tribunal also noticed that the seating capacity of the offending vehicle was 19 persons including the driver and that there was no evidence placed on record by the insurer that there were more than 19 people traveling in the offending vehicle at the time of the accident. It noticed that the offending vehicle did not carry a fitness certificate and therefore, held that the insurer is not liable to pay the compensation and directed the driver and owner of the offending vehicle to pay the compensation.

10. Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid Judgment and Award in so far as the liability to pay the compensation is concerned, the driver and owner have filed these appeals.

11. I have heard the learned counsel for the respective appellant and the contesting respondent/s in these appeals.

12. Learned counsel for appellants' relied upon Judgment of Division Bench of this Court in M.F.A No.3424/2006 (Oriental Insurance Company Limited vs. K.V. Chandrashekar Reddy and another disposed of on 19.03.2010) and contended that it is for the insurer to ascertain whether the vehicle in question is covered by fitness certificate and if it has chosen to issue a policy notwithstanding the fact that the offending vehicle did not carry a fitness certificate, then it is liable to pay the compensation. As the offending vehicle was covered by a policy of insurance which was in force as on the date of the accident, the insurer cannot be exonerated from its liability to pay the compensation.

13. The learned counsel for the insurer contended that the owner cannot file appeals in view of the bar contained in Section 173(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'the M.V. Act') as the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is less than Rs.10,000/-.

14. On the contrary, the learned counsel for the owner and driver submitted that the only ground on which liability is fastened by the Tribunal on the driver and owner is that the offending vehicle did not possess a fitness certificate. He contended that Section 173(2) of the M.V. Act bars challenge to the quantum of compensation if it is below Rs.10,000/- and that would not debar the owner and driver from challenging the liability saddled on them.
15. It is not in dispute that the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle. It is also not in dispute that the students / claimants, who were traveling in the offending vehicle suffered injuries which were though simple in nature, yet the claimants had all suffered injuries. The accident must have caused some amount of discomfort, pain and suffering to claimants.

16. In that view of the matter, the Tribunal was justified in awarding the compensation to claimants.
17. In so far as the question regarding maintainability of these appeals, Section 173(2) of the M.V. Act undoubtedly prohibits filing of an appeal challenging the compensation if it is less than Rs.10,000/-. Section 173 of the M.V. Act reads as under:
aggrieved by an award of a Claims Tribunal may, within ninety days from the date of the award, prefer an appeal to the High Court:
Provided that no appeal by the person who is required to pay any amount in terms of such award shall be entertained by the High Court unless he has deposited with it twenty-five thousand rupees or fifty per cent. of the amount so awarded, whichever is less, in the manner directed by the High Court:
Provided further that the High Court may entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal in time.

(2) No appeal shall lie against any award of a Claims Tribunal if the amount in dispute in the appeal is less than ten thousand rupees."
18. A similar provision is also found in Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the same is extracted as under:


19. Under Section 149 of the M.V. Act, the insurer is under a duty to satisfy the Judgments and Awards against persons insured in respect of third party risk. In the present case, the offending vehicle is undoubtedly covered by a certificate of insurance issued by the insurer. The only ground on which the liability to pay the compensation is fastened on the owner and driver is that the vehicle in question did not carry a fitness certificate. The requirement to carry a fitness certificate by a vehicle is specified in Section 84 of the M.V. Act and the same is extracted below:


(b) that the vehicle to which the permit relates is not driven at a speed exceeding the speed permitted under this Act;
(c) that any prohibition or restriction imposed and any fares or freight fixed by notification made under section 67 are observed in connection with the vehicle to which the permit relates;
(d) that the vehicle to which the permit relates is not driven in contravention of the provisions of section 5 or section 113;
(e) that the provisions of this Act limiting the hours of work of drivers are observed in connection with any vehicle or vehicles to which the permit relates;
(f) that the provisions of Chapters X, XI and XII so far as they apply to the holder of the permit are observed; and
(g) that the name and address of the operator shall be painted or otherwise firmly affixed to every vehicle to which the permit relates on the exterior of the body of that vehicle on both sides thereof in a colour or colours vividly contrasting to the colour of the vehicle centered as high as practicable below the window line in bold letters."

20. The Apex Court as well as the Division Bench of this Court has held that violation of a permit condition would not exonerate the liability of an insurer to pay the compensation. Even otherwise, when the insurer has chosen to issue a policy of insurance without insisting upon a fitness certificate, the insurer has insured the offending vehicle at its own peril. Therefore, the insurer cannot turn around and contend that it is not liable to pay the compensation.

21. Reverting back to the question as to whether the appeals filed by the owner and driver are maintainable, the purpose of Section 173(2) of the M.V. Act is apparently to ensure that the victim or the injured or the legal representatives of the deceased are not harassed by an unending litigation over trivial compensation. If only the Tribunal was aware that the insurer cannot be exonerated of its liability to pay the compensation, the Tribunal would have undoubtedly fixed the liability to pay the compensation upon the insurer and not upon the owner and driver of the offending vehicle. As the issue in the present case is regarding the liability to pay the compensation and not the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal, Section 173(2) of the M.V. Act will have to be interpreted to mean that no appeal challenging the quantum of compensation less than Rs.10,000/- can be entertained and that an appeal challenging the liability to pay the compensation could still be entertained.

22. In this regard, it is worthwhile to refer to the Judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Divisional Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Suresh Subray Shet and Others reported in 2009 ACJ 2089. Para No.9 of the said judgment reads as under:


23. The appeals filed by the driver and owner of the offending vehicle are hence allowed in part and the impugned Judgment and Award passed by the Tribunal only in so far as it relates to fastening the liability to pay the compensation upon the driver and owner of the offending vehicle is set aside. It is declared that the insurer / respondent No.1 in these appeals is liable to pay the compensation along with interest as awarded by the Tribunal.

24. The insurer shall deposit the compensation and interest within a month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this Judgment.

25. The amount in deposit shall be refunded to the owner after proper verification.
