Author: Ms. Balwinder Singh
1. Vide this judgment, I shall dispose of the present challans filed by the prosecution under Section 66.1/192A, DMVR 6/177 and RRR 32/177 of Motor Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 Vehicle Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as M.V. Act). The brief fact of the case as per prosecution are that on 25.12.2012 at about 04.50 pm the accused Babu Ram was driving one Chartered Bus bearing No. DL­1PC­2088 at Ahinsa Sthal while coming from Lado Sarai side and going towards 100 foota road side. It is the case of the prosecution that the accused was carrying passengers inside his vehicle. He was stopped by the traffic official on duty at that place and was asked to produce contract carriage permit of the vehicle, registration certificate of the vehicle and his PSV driving badge issued by the Transport Department. However, the accused could not produced either of the mentioned documents. It is further the case of the prosecution that there was no trained conductor or helper present inside the bus at the time when the offending vehicle was stopped by the traffic official for the purpose of checking. It is further noted by the traffic official that the helpline number of transport department was also not printed on any side of the bus as required by the rules. Therefore, the accused was challaned for the violation of offences U/s 66.1/192A, DMVR 6/177 and RRR 32/177 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 vide challan bearing No.645919 which is Ex.PW­1/A. The prosecution has also submitted before the court that since the driver could not produce contract carriage permit, registration certificate of the vehicle, his driving badge and also due to the fact that the helpline number of the transport department was also not printed on the bus, the owner of the vehicle is also liable for the violation of permit conditions u/s 66.1/192A, the owner of the vehicle Smt. Parveen Lal has also been arrayed as an accused and a challan bearing No. 645920 was issued against her which is Ex.PW­1/B for the violation of permit condition U/s 66.1/192A of M.V. Act. The offending vehicle was also Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 impounded by the challaning officer under Section 207 of M.V. Act and O.S.S. Form was also issued to the accused which is Ex.PW­1/C.
2. Since the offences are bailable, both the accused/driver as well as the owner of the vehicle were admitted on bail on furnishing of bail bond and surety bond in a sum of Rs.10,000/­. An application for the release of offending vehicle on superdari was moved by the owner of the vehicle and the same was accepted and the vehicle was released on superdari on furnishing of superdarinama in a sum of Rs.10,00,000/­.

3. Notice of accusation was served upon both the accused/driver as well as the owner of the vehicle U/s 251 CrPC to which both the accused/driver and the owner of the vehicle pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined two witnesses namely PW1 SI V.S. Deol, No.1858D and PW2 Const. Ashok Kumar , No. 4457T and also proved the challan which is Ex.PW­1/A.
PW1, in his examination­in­chief deposed that on the day of incident i.e. 25.12.2012 he was posted on duty at Ahinsa Sthal, Anuvrat Marg alongwith the PW2 Const. Ashok Kumar. At around 04.50 p.m. the accused/driver of the offending vehicle bearing No. DL­1PC­2088 Babu Ram came from Lado Sarai side with the bus and he was going towards 100 Foota road. Passengers were traveling inside the bus. After noticing the offending vehicle PW1 directed accused/driver to stop his bus for the purpose of checking. On his direction the accused/driver stop the abovementioned bus Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 and thereafter, he asked the accused/driver to produce the documents of the vehicle. As per the testimony of PW1 the accused/ driver showed his valid driving license. However, he could not produce his PSV driving badge, registration certificate and valid contract carriage permit of the vehicle. PW1 further noticed that there was no conductor present inside the bus and the details of the owner of the vehicle and helpline number of the transport department was also missing i.e. not printed on the exterior body of the vehicle. Therefore, PW1 issued a challan against the accused/driver which is Ex.PW1/A and the offending vehicle was also impounded u/s 207 M.V. Act and an OSS form was issued to the accused which is Ex.PW1/C.
In his cross examination, PW1 deposed that as submitted by him in his examination in chief, the present challan against accused was issued since he could not produce valid driving badge, registration certificate, contract carriage permit of the vehicle and also for the reason that helpline number of the transport department and details of the owner of the vehicle were not found to be printed on the exterior body of the vehicle. PW1 further deposed in his cross examination that there were around 30­35 passengers inside the vehicle and they were traveling from AIIMS to IFFCO Chowk, Gurgaon. PW1 also deposed he tried to note down the name and address of those passengers but they did not told him anything. In the end PW1 negated the suggestion of defence counsel that no passenger was traveling in the bus and that he is deposing falsely in the present case.
In his examination­in­chief, PW2 deposed that on the day of incident, he was posted on duty at Mehrauli Traffic Circle and was performing his duty at Lado Sarai T­point near Ahinsa Sthal alongwith PW1 SI V.S Deol. Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 At about 04.50 pm the accused/driver came with the bus from Lado Sarai side. PW1 directed him to signal the accused/driver to stop his bus. Accordingly, he signaled the accused/driver and he stopped the bus. Thereafter, PW2 asked the accused/deriver to go down from the bus and to bring his documents and come alongwith him to PW1 ZO/SI V.S. Deol. PW1 SI V.S. Deol inspected the documents of the vehicle and he found that the accused did not have his PSV driving badge, valid contract carriage permit and registration certificate of the vehicle. PW2 further deposed that there was no conductor present inside the bus and the details of the owner of the vehicle and the helpline number of the transport authority were not printed on the exterior body of the vehicle. As per the testimony of PW2 around 30­35 passengers were sitting inside the vehicle when it was stopped by them. Thereafter, PW1 issued a challan against accused/driver which is Ex.PW1/A and also impounded the vehicle u/s 207 of M.V. Act.
In his cross­examination PW2 deposed that PW1 SI V.S. Deol counted the passengers inside the bus and at that time he was not present inside the bus. He further deposed that PW1 did not made any of those passenger who were present inside the vehicle a witness in the present case nor did he photographed or videographed the offending vehicle. In the end PW2 negated the suggestion of the defence counsel that he was not present at the spot and also that the vehicle was not impounded and that he is deposing falsely in the present case.

5. PE was closed on 10.07.2013 and thereafter the statements of accused/driver u/s 313 Cr.P.C was recorded. The owner of the vehicle moved Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 an application that her examination u/s 313 Cr.P.C be dispensed with since she is not well and that she will not be prejudiced if her examination is dispensed with u/s 313 Cr.P.C. The application of the owner of the vehicle was allowed and the court proceeded further with recording the examination of accused/driver Babu Ram u/s 313 Cr.P.C. During the examination of accused U/s 313 CrPC, the entire incriminating evidence appearing against the accused was put to him and he was given an opportunity to explain the incriminating evidence appearing against him to which he submitted that he accept all the allegations against him that he was not carrying his PSV driving badge, registration certificate and contract carriage permit of the vehicle when he was stopped by the traffic official on duty. However, it is incorrect that the helpline number of the State Transport Authority and details of owner of the vehicle were not printed on the exterior body of the vehicle.
6. After examination of the accused/driver U/s 313 CrPC, defence counsel submitted that they do not wish to lead defence evidence in the present case but wants to submit the documents of the vehicle. They produced original registration certificate and contract carriage of the permit of the vehicle which are valid. The original documents were seen by the court and returned to the parties and copies thereof were taken on record and Marked as Annexure A and B. Thereafter, the matter was fixed for hearing on final arguments.
7. I have heard Ld. APP for the State as well as Ld. Defence Counsel at length and have carefully gone through the entire record and evidence and after carefully perusing the same, I am giving my finding as per below: Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 In the present challan, the accused/driver was challaned for the violations of Section 66.1/192A, 6/177 and 32/177 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and owner of the vehicle was challaned only for section 66/192A.

8. Thus in order to prove the guilt of the accused and to sustain his conviction the prosecution is required to establish beyond reasonable doubts that:
Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088
1. The accused committed violation under DMVR 6/177 of Motor Vehicle Act i.e. he did not have valid PSV driving badge.
2. The accused committed violation under RRR 32/177 of M.V. Act i.e. he did not produce registration certificate and contract carriage permit of the vehicle on demand of the challaning officer.
3. Both the accused committed violation u/s 66/192A of Motor Vehicle Act for the reason :
(i) The offending vehicle did not have a valid contract carriage permit, or
(ii) that accused has violated the condition of Contract Carriage Permit by violating the condition prescribed under clause (g) of sec. 84 which also amounts to violation of permit conditions ,i.e, "the name and address of the operator shall be painted or otherwise firmly affixed to every vehicle to which the permit relates on the exterior of the body of that vehicle on both sides thereof in a colour or colours vividly contrasting to the colour of the vehicle centred as high as practicable below the window line in bold letters.".
To prove this, firstly Ld. APP for State has argued before the court that both the prosecution witness namely PW1 SI V.S. Deol and PW2 Ct. Ashok Kumar have proved the challan on record and have correctly identified the accused. Both the prosecution witnesses have remained consistent in their testimonies. However, the Ld. Defence counsel has submitted that there are many discrepancies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses.
(1) With respect to the accusations levelled against the accused Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 under rule DMVR 6/177 of M.V. Act i.e. not having a valid PSV driving badge, the Ld. APP for the accused has argued before the court that both PW1 & PW2 have categorically deposed before the court that the accused/driver was driving his vehicle without having a valid PSV badge. In his statement u/s 313 Cr.P.C also he accepted that he was without a valid PSV badge. In his defence evidence, he did not produce any documents disclosing that he has a valid PSV badge. Therefore, this allegations stands proved against him. On the other hand, Ld. Defence counsel has further submitted that the present challan was chalked out on 25.12.2012 whereas the notification which made it mandatory for every person driving a commercials passenger vehicle to have a valid PSV driving badge came into force in the month of May 2013 and it was only prospective in operation. Therefore, it would not covered the cases in which the above mentioned violation took place before the date of operation of the above mentioned notification. Therefore, it would not apply in the present case as well. Therefore, the accused is not guilty of any violation under DMVR 6/177 of Motor Vehicle Act.
The court does not find any merit in the submission of Ld. Defence Counsel as when the substantive provision is already there, there is no need of any further notification regarding the same provision or requirement on the part of State Transport Authority and, therefore, since the accused could not produce his Valid Driving Badge he stands convicted for the offence under Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 DMVR 6/177 of M.V. Act.
(2) With respect to the accusations levelled against the accused under rule RRR 32/177 of M.V. Act i.e. not producing the registration certificate and valid contract carriage permit of the vehicle, the Ld. APP for the State has argued before the court that both PW1 & PW2 have deposed in their testimonies that the accused did not produce valid contract carriage permit and the registration certificate of the vehicle on their demand. Even in his statement u/s 313 Cr.P.C, the accused admitted the fact that he did not produce the abovementioned documents when demanded by the challaning officer.
The court finds merits in the submission of Ld APP for the state and in view of the admission of the accused this allegation also stand proved against him and he stands convicted for the same (3) Lastly, with respect to the accusations levelled against both the accused U/s 66/192A of M.V. Act there are two questions for consideration before the court.
Firstly, whether the offending vehicle was without any valid Contract Carriage Permit - This question needs no further deliberation as the accused has already placed on record the original valid Contract Carriage Permit and the copy of the same is marked as Annexure­B.
Now, the second question for consideration before the court is whether the accused has violated the condition of Contract Carriage Permit by violating clause (g) of sec. 84 which also amounts to violation of permit conditions,i.e, the details of the operator of the vehicle were missing on the Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 vehicle.
Before coming to any conclusion with respect to the abovementioned allegations, the court has to again appreciate the evidence of PW1 and PW2 for the same.
Ld. Counsel for the accused has pointed out that there are many inconsistencies and loopholes in the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 which raises serious doubts as to the veracity of the prosecution story. Ld. counsel for the accused has argued before the court that as per the testimonies of both PW1 and PW2 the details of the owner of the vehicle and the helpline number of the State Transport Authority were not printed on the exterior body of the vehicle. As per their deposition around 30­35 passengers were traveling inside the bus but neither of the prosecution witness made any serious efforts to persuade any of those passengers to be a witness in the present case nor did they issued any notice to them for not abiding their directions for refusal to be a witness to substantiate their abovementioned allegations against the accused/driver. Ld. Defence Counsel has further argued that PW2 has deposed in his cross examination that PW1 ZO/SI V.S. Deol did not took any photographs of the vehicle nor did he made any efforts to collect any video graphic record by videographing the bus which he should have made for the purpose of establishing that actually the details of the owner of the vehicle and the helpline number of the State Transport Authority were missing on the exterior body of the vehicle. Ld. counsel for the accused has argued that it is a settled proposition of law that when independent public witnesses are available at the spot they must be joined as public witnesses. In the case of non­joining of public witnesses even when they were available and no plausible explanation Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 coming forth from the prosecution for the same, the case of the prosecution should be seen with reasonable circumspection as it would be unsafe to believe the story of prosecution in absence of the independent public witnesses. Similar views have been expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sanspal Singh Vs. State of Delhi, 1999, Cr.L.J 1a.
All these omissions on the part of both the prosecution witnesses clearly reflects that the allegations against the accused/driver as well as owner of the vehicle that details of the vehicle and helpline number of the State Transport Authority were not printed on the exterior body of the vehicle are baseless and stands not proved.
I find merits in the submissions of Ld. Defence Counsel as the omission pointed out are very relevant. The prosecution witnesses should have made some efforts to prove on record that the offending vehicle was actually plying without having the details of the owner of the vehicle and helpline number of the State Transport Authority on it. There is no documentary or any other proof available on record which corroborates the allegations of prosecution witnesses. Hence, the allegations against both the accused/driver and owner of the vehicle that the details of the owner of the vehicle and the helpline number of the State Transport Authority were not printed on the exterior body of the vehicle, remains not proved.
Since both the abovementioned allegations for permit violation i.e. (a) not having a valid contract carriage permit, and (b) no details of the owner of the vehicle and helpline number of the State Transport Authority on the exterior body of the vehicle, are not proved against the accused and owner of the vehicle, both of them are acquitted of the charges u/s 66/192A of Motor Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 Vehicle Act.

9. Hence, after all the discussion above, the court is of the opinion that the prosecution has not been able to proved the accusations levelled against both the accused driver as well as owner of the vehicle U/s 66/192A of M.V. Act beyond all reasonable doubts and both of them stands acquitted of the same. However, the accusation levelled against the accused/driver under DMVR 6/177 and RRR 32/177 of M.V. Act stands proved beyond all reasonable doubts and he is held guilty for the same.
Let the accused/driver be heard separately on quantum of sentence. Copy of this judgment be given free of cost to both the accused. Pronounced in the open court.
Announced in the open court (Balwinder Singh) on 4 day of October, 2013 th Metropolitan Magistrate­03, Traffic, South District, Saket, New Delhi.
Vehicle No. : DL­1PC­2088 ORDER ON SENTENCE Heard on the quantum of sentence. The Ld. APP for the state has argued that the accused driver has been convicted for the offences under DMVR 6/177 & RRR 32/177 of M.V. Act and, therefore, he should be strictly punished for the violation.
On the other hand the Ld. Defence counsel for the accused has stated that accused driver is a poor person and that this is his first offence. Thus, prayed that a lenient view may be taken.
Taking the financial condition of the accused into consideration and the fact that it is his first offence a lenient view is taken against the accused in the interest of justice and he is admonished for the same.
Documents seized, if any, be released to the rightful party as per law.
File be consigned to record room after due compliance.
