Punjab-Haryana High Court
Suraksha Foundation vs State Of Punjab And Another on 22 July, 2009
CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.S.THAKUR, CHIEF JUSTICE.
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA.
1. Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment?
2. Whether to be referred to the reporters or not?
3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Present: Mr. Puneet Bali Advocate for the petitioner.
Mr. Rupinder Khosla, Additional Advocate General, Punjab, for the respondents.
T.S. Thakur, C.J. (Oral) This writ petition has been filed in public interest. It prays for a mandamus directing the respondents to comply with the provisions of Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and to prepare and implement the plan for installation of electronic speed limiters/speed governors to ensure safety of passengers and other road users who suffer heavy causalities on account of frequent motor vehicle accidents in the State of Punjab.

Precisely stated the petitioner's case is that while road safety is a matter of paramount importance, the Government of Punjab has, despite the mandate of Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, failed to rise to the occasion and issue a notification requiring installation of speed governors in such transport vehicles as may be included in a notification envisaged under the Rule. The petitioner's further case is that in the States of Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, Union Territory of Chandigarh and in the neighbouring State of Haryana, the respective State Governments have taken steps and notified the installation of speed governors in transport vehicle as an essential requirement for registering and plying of such vehicles. The petitioner also points out that the need for regulation of speed and installation of speed governors has been examined by the Courts and directions issued on the subject including those by the Supreme Court of India. In the State of Punjab, however, the Government has done nothing of the kind and remains insensitive to the need for enforcing provisions of the Rules and resultantly ensuring safety of passengers travelling in transport vehicles and pedestrians alike. The petitioner, therefore, prays for a direction to the respondents to comply with the provisions of Rule 118 of the Rules, mentioned above, and to stipulate installation and fixing of speed governors as an essential condition before a vehicle used for carrying passengers or goods is registered.
Mr. Bali, learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that while fixing of speed governors could be made effective immediately qua vehicles brought for registration after the issue of a notification by the State Government, all such vehicles as are already registered and in use could be given reasonable time to satisfy that requirement. Relying upon the directions issued by the High Court of Karnataka, in C.W.P. No. 10416 of 2007, Mr. Bali submitted that the Court had, in that case, granted three months time to the vehicles already registered for getting the speed governors installed while making it mandatory for any new vehicle coming for registration to have such speed limiters/governors fitted in it.
Section 84 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, stipulates the general conditions attached to all permits. One of those conditions is that the vehicle covered by the permit shall not be driven at a speed exceeding the speed permitted under the Act. It reads:

Section 112 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, in turn, deals with the limits of speed and inter-alia provides that the State Government or any authority authorized in that behalf may if satisfied that it is necessary to restrict the speed of motor vehicles in the interest of public safety and convenience and because of the nature of any road or bridge, by notification issued in the official Gazette, fix such maximum speed limit as it thinks fit for motor vehicles or any specified class or description of motor vehicles. Sub Section 2 to Section 112 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, reads as under:-
authorized in this behalf by the state Government may , if satisfied that it is necessary to restrict the speed of motor vehicles in the interest of public safety or convenience or because of the nature of any road or bridge, by notification in the Official Gazette and by causing appropriate traffic signs to be placed or erected under section 116 at suitable places, fix such maximum speed limits or minimum speed limits as it thinks fit for motor vehicles or any specified class or description of motor vehicles or for motor vehicles to which a trailer is attached, either generally or in a particular area or on a particular road or roads :
Provided that no such notification is necessary if any restriction under this section is to remain in force for not more than one month".
In exercise of powers vested in the Government under the above provision, a notification dated 27.9.2007 has been issued by which speed limits in respect of different vehicles have been determined and notified in relation to National Highways and State Highways including the stretches for which they run through Municipal Areas. It is noteworthy that for a medium or heavy goods vehicle or a medium or heavy passenger motor vehicle, the maximum speed limit prescribed is 65 kilometers per hour, on National Highways and 55 Kilometers per hour on the State Highways. Such limit is 40 kilometers per hour while the National Highways or State Highways run through a municipal area. In the case of a medium or heavy goods vehicle or medium or heavy passenger motor vehicle drawing trailer, such limit is 40 Kilometers and 50 kilometers per hour, respectively, on the National Highways and State Highways and 30 Kilometers per hour when such Highways pass through municipal areas. In the case of light motor vehicles, and other vehicles, the speed limits have been similarly fixed.
The issue of the notification aforementioned makes it manifest that the State has itself recognized the need for restricting the speed for motor vehicles in the interest of public safety or convenience and accordingly, stipulated such limits. There is no gainsaying that the fixing of speed limits is not intended to be a mere ritual or paper work. The purpose on the contrary is to enforce such limits by taking appropriate action against those found violating the same. What is, however, important is that the speed limits can be enforced not only by actual physical check on the Highways but even by mechanical means like fixing of speed governors/speed limiters. That is what Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, is intended to achieve. It, inter- alia, empowers the State Government to notify transport vehicles that shall be fitted by the Operators of such transport vehicles with a speed governor (speed controlling device) conforming to the prescribed standards in such a manner that the speed governors can be sealed with an official seal of the State Transport Authority or Regional Transport Authority. Sub Rule 2 to Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, provides that speed governors of every transport vehicle shall be so set that the vehicle is incapable of being driven at a speed in excess of the maximum pre-set speed of the vehicle except down an incline. Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, reads as under:-

Petitioner's grievance, in the present writ petition, is that although the Government, has by issuing a notification under Section 112(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, recognized in clear terms the need for limiting the speed of vehicles at National Highways & State Highways, yet the next logical step which the Government ought to have taken viz directing installation of speed governors in transport vehicles, has not been taken. It is argued by Mr. Bali, counsel appearing for the petitioner and in our opinion rightly so that the power vested in the Government under Rule 118 carries with it the duty to stipulate the fixation of speed governors as an essential requirement before a transport vehicle could be allowed to operate or to be registered. That is especially so when the provision is meant to protect the interest of innocent third parties. Fixing a speed limit, in terms of Section 112 (2) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, but failure to direct installation of speed governors as an essential requirement is an anomaly which cannot be countenanced. That is because the speed limit regime, envisaged under the Act and the Rules cannot be frustrated by inaction or apathy of the Government. It was also contended by the counsel that the State Government had, despite, opportunities granted by the Court over the past several hearings, failed to act in the matter or offer any logical explanation for its failure to issue a notification, in terms of Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, no matter other States in the Country including the neighbouring State of Haryana had introduced the requirement of speed governors not only in the transport vehicles owned and operated by the State owned Transport Corporations and Roadways, but also in the vehicles operated by private operators. There is, in our opinion, considerable merit in that submission also. Having recognized the need for fixing speed limits for different types of vehicles in exercise of statutory power, there is no real justification behind the failure of the State Government in not notifying vehicles that would require to be fitted with speed governors, in terms of rule 118 of the Rules mentioned above. We can understand that if the State Government decides not to notify each and every class of vehicles for the purpose of fixing of speed governors, but we cannot appreciate its failure in not directing installation of speed governors as an essential requirement even in the cases of transport vehicles for passengers and goods which are large in number and which pose a huge challenge to the road safety measures.
That apart we cannot ignore the fact that the State Government is itself operating transport service in the name & style of Punjab Roadways, Punbus and Pepsu Road Transport Corporation. Out of the total number of buses in the State those owned by these organizations may themselves run into a few thousand vehicles in which a very large number of passengers travel everyday to and fro different stations. These buses, like buses which are being operated by the private operators, are involved in road accidents, resulting in heavy causalities is also a fact that cannot be possibly denied. The number of cases arising under the Motor Vehicles Act, the amount of compensation that is paid only by the Insurance Companies and even by the Road Transport Corporations is a clear indication of the magnitude of the problem arising out of non prescription of safety measures and resultant loss of human lives. The State is not, therefore, justified in indefinitely postponing a decision regarding whether speed governors ought to be prescribed for all or in particular class of vehicles.
Having said so, we do not propose to completely clutch at the jurisdiction of Government and assume the power of identifying the class of vehicles that would require to be fitted with speed governors. Whether all or some only of the vehicles ought to be fitted with speed governors is a question that ought to be determined by the Government itself. All that we need say is that keeping in view the power reserved in favour of the Government and the notification issued for prescribing speed limits, the logical next step of prescribing speed governors as a requirement for registering and plying of vehicles is absolutely essential in heavy transport vehicles both for goods and for carrying of passengers. We also feel that if in other States like Kerala, Karnataka, Delhi, Haryana and Union Territory of Chandigarh, these measures have been considered to be necessary and have been stipulated, there is no reason why the people of State of Punjab should be denied the protection of such measures.
In the result, we allow this petition but only in part and to the following extent:-
1) The State Government shall by a suitable notification stipulate that no medium or heavy goods or passenger2 motor vehicle shall be registered by the Transport Authorities concerned unless the same are fitted with speed governors that comply with the requirement of Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, and restrict the maximum speed of such vehicles to the maximum prescribed for the same, in terms of notification dated 27.9.2007 issued by the State Government. The needful in this regard to be done within two months.
2) For the vehicles that are already registered, the State government shall stipulate a period of one year, from the date of this order, to be fitted with speed governors, failing which the Authorities shall take appropriate steps against violation of the said requirement.
3) The State Government shall, over and above the medium; heavy goods and passenger vehicles, examine whether speed governors are meant to be prescribed for any other class of vehicles. if so, the speed limit which the speed governors should permit for the same. The needful in this regard shall be done by the State Government, expeditiously, but not later than six months from today.
The writ petition is disposed off with the above directions leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
