Yogeshwar Prasad, Mrs. S.Dixit, G.V.Rao, A.V.Rangam, B.Parthasarthy and Ms. A. Subhashini for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KULDIP SINGH, J. The liberalization for private sector operations in the Road Transport field - under Section 80 and other provisions of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 - has been challenged in these bunch-petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution, filed by the existing-operators, primarily on the ground that they have been adversely affected in the exercise of their rights under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India.
It is necessary to notice the statutory provisions operating in the field of motor transport business prior to and after the coming into force of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter called 'the Act') The Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (hereinafter called 'the old Act was enacted and en- forced with the object of having closer control to establish a coordinated system of transport. The subject of 'Mechani- cally Propelled Vehicles' being in List-Ill of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution, various amendments were made from time to time by several State Legislatures either adding to or modifying the provisions of the old Act. Chap- ter IV of the old Act consisted of sections 42 to 68 provid- ing "control of transport vehicles". Sections 47 and 57, to the relevant-extent, are re-produced as under:-
Chapter V of the Act-substitute for Chapter IV of the old Act consisting of Sections 66 to 96, provides for 'co- ntrol of transport vehicles'. Sections 71, 72 and 80, to the relevant extent, are reproduced as under:
A comparative-reading of the provisions of the Act and the old Act make it clear that the procedure for grant of permits under the Act has been liberalised to such an extent that an intended operator can get a permit for asking irre- spective of the number of operators already in the field. Under Sections 57 read with Section 47(1) of the old Act an application for a stage carnage permit was to be published and kept for inspection in the office of the Regional Trans- port Authority so that the existing operators could file representations/objections against the said application. The application, along with objections, was required to be decided in a quasi-judicial manner, Section 47(3) of the old Act further permitted the imposition of limit on the grant of permits in any region, area or on a particular route. It is thus obvious that the main features of Chapter IV "con- trol of transport vehicles" under old Act were as under:
The Parliament in its wisdom has completely effaced the above features. The scheme envisaged under Section 47 and 57 of the old Act has been completely done away with by the Act. The right of existing-
operators to file objections and the provision to impose limit on the number of permits have been taken away. There is no similar provision to that of Section 47 and Section 57 under the Act. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act shows that the purpose of bringing in the Act was to liberalize the grant of permits. Section 71(1) of the Act provides that while considering an application for a stage carriage permit the Regional Transport Authority shall have regard to the objects of the Act. Section 80(2), which is the harbinger of Liberalisation, provides that a Regional Transport Authority shall not ordinarily refuse to grant an application for permit of any kind made at any time under the Act. There is no provision under the Act like that of Section 47(3) of the old Act and as such no limit for the grant of permits can be fixed under the Act. There is, however, a provision under Section 71(3) (a) of the Act under which a limit can be fixed for the grant of permits in respect of the routes which are within a town having popula- tion of more than five lakhs.
The petitioners are existing stage-carnage operators on different routes. They hold permits granted by the Regional Transport Authorities concerned. Mithlesh Garg, petitioner in Civil Writ Petition No. 1345/89 has stated that he holds a stage carnage permit and plies his vehicles on the Meerut-Parikshitgarh-Hasifabad-Laliana and allied routes under the jurisdiction of the Regional Transport Authority, Meerut. According to him prior to the enforcement of the Act, 23 permit-holders were operating on the said route but thereafter under Section 80 of the Act the Regional Trans- port Authority, Meerut has issued 272 more permits in re- spect of the same route. Similar facts have been stated in the other writ petitions. As mentioned above the petitioners are permit holders and are existing operators. They are plying their vehicles on the routes assigned to them under the permits. They are in the full enjoyment of their funda- mental right guaranteed to them under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. There is no threat of any kind whatsoever from any authority to the enjoyment of their right to carry on the occupation of transport operators. There is no complaint of infringement of any of their statu- tory rights. Their only effort is to stop the new operators from coming in the field as competitors. We see no justifi- cation in the petitioners' stand. More operators mean healthy-competition and efficient transport system. Over- crowded buses, passengers standing in the aisle, persons clinging to the bus-doors and even sitting on the roof-top are some of the common sights in this country. More often one finds a bus which has noisy engine, old upholstry, uncomfortable seats and continuous emission of black-smoke from the exhaust pipe. It is, therefore, necessary that there should be plenty of operators on every route to pro- vide ample choice to the commuter-public to board the vehi- cle of their choice and patronize the operator who is providing the best service. Even otherwise the liberal policy is likely to help in the elimination of corruption and favouritism in the process of granting permits. Re- stricted licensing under the old Act led to the concentra- tion of business in the hands of few persons thereby giving rise to a kind of monopoly, adversely affecting the public interest. The apprehensions of the petitioners, that too many operators on a route are likely to affect adversely the interest of weaker section of the profession, is without any basis. The transport business is bound to be ironed-out ultimately by the rationale of demand and supply. Cost of a vehicle being as it is the business requires huge invest- ment. The intending operators are likely to be conscious of the economics underlying the profession. Only such number of vehicles would finally remain in operation on a particular route as are economically viable. In any case the transport system in a state is meant for the benefit and convenience of the public. The policy to grant permits Liberally under the Act is directed towards the said goal. The petitioners who are already in the business want to keep the fresh entrants out of it and as such eliminate the healthy compe- tition which is necessary to bring efficiency in the trade. This Court in Jasbhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar & Ors., [1976] 3 S.C.R. 58 posed the following questions for its determina- tion:-
We, therefore, see on justification for the petitioners to complain against the liberalised policy for grant of permits under the Act.
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India guarantees to all citizens the right to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business subject to rea- sonable restrictions imposed by the State under Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Saghir Ahmad v. The State of U.P. and Others, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 707 held that the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) entitles, any member of the public to carry on the business of transporting passengers with the aid of the vehicles. Mukerjea, J. speaking for the Court observed as under:
It is thus a guaranteed fight of every citizen whether rich or poor to take up and carry on, if he so wishes, the motor transport business. It is only the State which can impose reasonable restrictions within the ambit of Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India. Section 47(3) and 57 of the old Act were some of the restrictions which were imposed by the State on the enjoyment of the fight under Article 19(1)(g) so far as the motor transport business was concerned. The said restrictions have been taken away and the provisions of Section 47(3) and 57 of the old Act have been repealed from the Statute Book. The Act provides liberal policy for the grant of permits to those who intend to enter the motor transport business. The provisions of the Act are in con- formity with Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. The petitioners are asking this Court to do what the Parlia- ment has undone. When the State has chosen not to impose any restriction under Article 19(6) of the Constitution of india in respect of motor transport business and has left the citizens to enjoy their right under Article 19(1)(g) there can be no cause for complaint by the petitioners. On an earlier occasion this Court dealt with somewhat similar situation. The Uttar Pradesh Government amended the old Act by the Motor Vehicle (U.P. Amendment) Act, 1972 and inserted Section 43A. The new Section 43-A apart from making certain changes in Section 47 of the old A Act also omitted sub-section (3) of Section 47 of the old Act) Section 43A provided that in the case of non nationalised routes, if the State Government was of the opinion that it was for the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants it might, by notification in the official gazette issue a direction accordingly. The necessary notification was issued with the result that the transport authorities were to proceed to grant permits as if sub-section (3) of section 47 was omitted and there was no limit for the grant of permits on any specified route within the region. Section 43-A and the consequent notification was challenged by the existing operators before the Allahabad High Court. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions. On appeal this Court in Hans Raj Kehar & Ors. v. The State of U.P. and Ors., [1975] 2 S.C,R. 916 dismissed the appeal. Khanna, J.speaking for the Court held as under;-
The identical situation has been created by Sections 71, 72 and 80 of the Act by omitting the provisions of Section 47(3) of the old Act. It has been made easier for any person to obtain a stage carriage permit under the Act. The attack of the petitioner on Section 80 on the ground of Article 19 has squarely been answered by this Court in Hans Raj Kehar's case (supra).
It has been contended in the writ petitions that differ- ent yard-sticks have been provided for interregion, intra- region and inter-State permits under the Act. According to the petitioners the imposition of limit for grant of inter-State permits is permissible under Section 88(5) of the Act whereas no such limit can be imposed in respect of intra-region permits. The contention is that the provisions are discriminatory and are violative of article 14 of the Constitution of India. We are not impressed by the argument. The three categories of permit- seekers cannot be considered to be belonging to the same class. Different criteria have been provided under the Act for granting permits in respect of each of the categories. It is nobody's case that Section 80 brings about discrimina- tion in the matter of grant of permits between applicants belonging to the same class. The argument on the ground of Article 14 is thus wholly untenable and is rejected. This question also came for consideration in Hans Raj Kehar's case (supra) and this Court rejected the contention in the following words:-
The learned counsel for the writ petitioners, have relied upon a later decision of this Court in Rameshwar Prasad & Ors., v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors., [1983] 2 S.C.C. 195 and have contended that the decision of this Court in Hans Raj Kehars case (supra) no longer holds the field. There is no force in the contention. This Court on two occasions interpreted the old Act as amended by the State of Uttar Pradesh at the relevant times. The provisions of law which were interpreted in Hans Raj Kehar's case were entirely different than those which were before this Court in Rameshwar Prasad's ease. The legal position with which we are faced in these writ petitions is almost similar to that which was considered by this Court in Hans Raj Kehar's case. What happened in the State of Uttar Pradesh was that after the U.P. Amendment of 1972 to the old Act, which was subject matter of interpretation before this Court in Hans Raj Kehars ease, it was found that certain anomalies had arisean in the working of the liberal policy of granting permits. With a view to remedy the situation the U.P. Legislature amended the old Act again by the U.P. Act 15 of 1976 permit- ting imposition of limit on the number of permits to be issued. In spite of the restrictions on grant of permits as provided in the U.P. Act 15 of 1976 the State Government issued notifications permitting grant of permits to all eligible applicants without any upper limit. This Court held in Ratneshwar Prasad's ease that the said notifications were inconsistent with the limitation as to the number of permits introduced by the U.P. Amending Act 1976 and as such were bad in law. Venkataramiah, J. (as he then was) speaking for the Court in Rameshwar Prasad's ease observed as under:
It is thus obvious that the reliance by the petitioners on the ratio and observations of this Court in Rameshwar Prasad's case is wholly mis-
placed. The Parliament has, under the Act, made a clear departure from the policy and has reverted to the position which was before this Court in Hans Raj Kehar's case. Relying on Rameshwar Prasad's case the petitioners contend that it is in 'public interest' to limit the grant of permits on intra-region routes and while fixing the limit various factors indicated by this Court in the said case are to be taken into consideration. We do not agree. The concept of public interest, in relation to motor transport business, as propounded by this Court in Rameshwar Prasad's case was only in the context of the old Act as amended by the U.P. Act. We are of the view that the Act having brought-in complete change in the policy of granting permits, the observations of this Court in Rameshwar Prasad's case are not relevant in the present context. The provisions of law for consideration before this Court in Hans Raj Kehar's case were almost similar to Section 80 of the Act. We are, there- fore, bound by the law laid down by the four-Judges Bench of this Court in Hans Raj Kehar's case.
The petitioners have further contended that the condi- tions of roads, social status of the applicants, possibility of small operators being eliminated by big operators, condi- tions of hilly routes, fuel availability and pollution control are some of the important factors which the Regional Transport Authority is bound to take into consideration while taking a decision on an application for grant of permit. These are the matters which are supposed to be within the comprehension of the transport authorities. The legislative policy under the Act cannot be challenged on these grounds. It is not disputed that the Regional Trans- port Authority has the power under the Act to refuse an application for grant of permit by giving reasons. It is for the authority to take into consideration all the relevant factors at the time of quasi-judicial consideration of the applications for grant of permits. The statutory authorities under the Act are bound to keep a watch on the erroneous and illegal exercise of power in granting permits under the liberalised policy.
We, therefore, see no force in any of the contentions raised by the petitioners and as such we dismiss the writ petitions. The parties are left to bear their own costs.
