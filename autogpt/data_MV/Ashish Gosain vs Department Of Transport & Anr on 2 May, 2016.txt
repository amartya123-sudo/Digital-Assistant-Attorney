Delhi High Court
Ashish Gosain vs Department Of Transport & Anr on 2 May, 2016
1. The petitioner has challenged the suspension order whereby his driving licence has been suspended under Section 19(1)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
2. Factual matrix 2.1 The petitioner received a show cause notice dated 18th January, 2016 to show cause why he should not be disqualified for holding a driving licence under Section 19(1)(f) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989.
The relevant portion of the notice dated 18th January, 2016 is reproduced hereunder:
2.2 The petitioner submitted the reply dated 27th January, 2016 in which the petitioner sought better particulars namely date/place of occurrence and nature of alleged offence to enable him to reply to the show cause notice. The petitioner also sought personal hearing before any decision is taken on the show cause notice. Relevant portion of the reply is reproduced hereunder:
2.3 Vide order dated 11th February, 2016, the Motor Licensing Officer suspended the petitioner's licence for a period of six months under Section 19(1)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act. Relevant portion of the suspension order is reproduced hereunder:
3. Grounds of challenge 3.1 The show cause notice dated 18th January, 2016 issued by respondent no.1 is invalid inasmuch as it does not provide the relevant particulars, namely, date/place of occurrence and nature of the offence alleged to have been committed by the petitioner. 3.2 Vide dated 27th January, 2016, the Petitioner sought better particulars and personal hearing. However, respondent no.1 did not furnish the relevant particulars sought for by the petitioner. 3.3 The respondent did not afford any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner which is mandatory under Section 19(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act.
3.4 No reasons have been recorded in the impugned order. Respondent no.1 did not consider the petitioner's objections. The impugned order is a cyclostyled form in which the name of the petitioner and his driving licence number has been filled up which shows non-application of mind.
3.5 The show cause notice dated 27th January, 2016 refers to Section 19(1)(f) of the Motor Vehicles Act whereas the licence has been suspended under Section 19(1)(d) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
3.6 The petitioner had compounded the alleged offence upon payment of fine of Rs.400/- and therefore, the suspension of licence for the same offence amounts to double jeopardy. Once the offence has been compounded by payment of challan, the offender stands discharged and no further proceedings can be taken against such a person. Any further proceedings under the Motor Vehicle Act after composition are expressly prohibited by Section 200(2) of Motor Vehicles Act. Reference is also made to sub-Section (8) of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which clearly prescribes the effect of composition of an offence namely, the acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been compounded. Reliance is placed on Principal Chief Conservator of Forests v. J.K. Johnson, (2011) 10 SCC 794.
4. Submissions of the respondents Mr. Rahul Mehra, learned senior standing counsel for Govt. of NCT of Delhi submits that the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety has issued directions on 18th August, 2015 to the effect that the driving licences should be suspended for a period of not less than three months under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 in cases of driving at speed exceeding the specified limit, red light jumping, carrying overload in good carriages, carrying persons in good carriages, driving under the influence of liquor/drugs and using mobile phone while driving. It is submitted that compounding of the offence under Section 200 of the Motor Vehicles Act does not, in any manner, take away the right of the Licensing Authority to suspend the licence under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Reference is made to Sections 183 and 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act dealing with the offence of driving at excessive speed and driving dangerously, respectively, which can be compounded under Section 200(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 200 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act provides that upon compounding of the offence, no further proceeding shall be taken in respect of such offence. However, the power to suspend the licence under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act upon satisfaction of the Licensing Authority with respect to any of the conditions mentioned in Section 19(1)(a) to (h) is dehors the compounding of the offence under Section 200 of the Motor Vehicle Act. It is submitted that the respondents are complying with the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety. However, it is not disputed that the opportunity of hearing has not been afforded to the petitioner.
5. Relevant provisions 5.1. Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 "Section 19-Power of licensing authority to disqualify from holding a driving licence or revoke such licence.
(1) If a licensing authority is satisfied, after giving the holder of a driving licence an opportunity of being heard, that he -

(i) disqualifying that person for a specified period for holding or obtaining any driving licence to drive all or any classes or descriptions of vehicles specified in the licence; or
(ii) revoke any such licence.
(2) Where an order under sub-section (1) is made, the holder of a driving licence shall forthwith surrender his driving licence to the licensing authority making the order, if the driving licence has not already been surrendered, and the licensing authority shall, -
(a) if the driving licence is a driving licence issued under this Act, keep it until the disqualification has expired or has been removed; or
(b) if it is not a driving licence issued under this Act, endorse the disqualification upon it and send it to the licensing authority by which it was issued; or

(3) Any person aggrieved by an order made by a licensing authority under sub-section (1) may, within thirty days of the receipt of the order, appeal to the prescribed authority, and such appellate authority shall give notice to the licensing authority and hear either party if so required by that party and may pass such order as it thinks fit and an order passed by any such appellate authority shall be final."
(Emphasis supplied) 5.2. Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 "Rule 21-Powers of licensing authority to disqualify. For the purpose of clause (f) of subsection (1) of section 19, the commission of the following acts by holder of a driving licence shall constitute nuisance or danger to the public, namely:--
6. Directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety 6.1. Directions dated 18.08.2015 of the Supreme Court Committee The Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety has issued directions dated 18th August, 2015 to the effect that the driving license should be suspended for not less than three months for high speed driving, carrying overload in goods carriage, carrying persons in goods carriage, drunken driving and using mobile funds while driving under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989. Relevant portion of the order dated 18th August, 2015 is reproduced hereunder:
Vide circular dated 08th December, 2015, the Special Commissioner (Traffic) of Delhi Police issued a circular dated 8th December, 2015 to implement the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety. Relevant portion of the circular is reproduced hereunder:
8. Findings 8.1. India has the dubious distinction of having highest number of road accidents. According to the Road Transport Ministry report of 2014, a total of 4,89,400 road accidents were reported in 2014 resulting in 1,39,671 deaths i.e. an average of one road accident every minute resulting in one death every 4 minutes which is highest in the world. This Court agrees with the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety that unless strong and urgent measures are taken to deal with speeding, drunken driving, red light jumping, the use of mobile phones while driving, and over loading, the number of accidents and fatalities will continue to remain high.
8.2. The directions issued by the Supreme Court Committee on the Road Safety for suspension of licence for a period of not less than three months under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act in cases of driving at excessive speed, overloading, drunken driving and using mobile phone while driving, warrant strict implementation by Delhi Police as well as Transport Department. However, the Delhi Police as well as the Transport Department have to follow due process of law which is as under:-
8.3. Mr. Rahul Mehra, learned senior standing counsel for Govt. of NCT of Delhi submits that in order to implement the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety, the respondents have formulated the following procedure:
8.3.1. In cases of violations specified in the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on the Road Safety, the concerned police officer/enforcement officer shall seize the driving licence for initiating proceedings for suspension of licence under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The acknowledgement of the seizure of the driving licence shall notify the driving licence holder that the driving licence is liable to be suspended for a period of not less than three months in terms of the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety. The revised acknowledgment format is reproduced hereunder:-
8.3.2. The licence seized by the Enforcement Officer shall be forwarded to the Motor Licensing Officer of the Transport Department who shall thereafter issue a show cause notice to the licence holder to show cause why his licence should not be suspended under Section 19(1) (d) and (f) of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 in terms of the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on the Road Safety. The revised draft notice format is reproduced hereunder:

I, __________________, Motor Licensing Officer, as per the powers conferred to undersigned under Section-19(1)(d) & (f) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 21 of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, hereby call upon your explanation as to why your driving license should not be suspended under Section 19(1)(d) & (f) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the relevant Rules made there under for a period not less than three months in compliance of the directions of Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety (F.No05/2014/CoRS-Part-III dated 18.08.2015 and F.No.05/2014/CoRS-Part-III dated 17.11.2015) available online on the web site of Delhi Traffic Police at the link https://delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/about-us/notifications. The reply must reach the undersigned within 10 days of issue of this letter, failing which ex parte decision will be taken. The personal hearing on your reply shall be provided to you by the undersigned on _______, at _________ (time) at _______ (place).
Motor Licensing Officer ___________ Zonal Office"
8.3.3. The Motor Licensing Officer shall afford a hearing to the driving licence holder, who seeks the same in his reply. The suspension order shall be passed after considering the reply and the submissions made by the licence holder at the time of oral hearing. The suspension order shall be sent to the driving licence holder by Regd. AD Post. The suspension order shall carry a note that the driving licence holder is entitled to an appeal under Section 19 (3) of the Motor Vehicles Act before the Appellate Authority within a period of one month from the date of the order.
8.3.4. The competent Transport Authority shall endeavour to complete the adjudicatory process preferably within a period of 90 days, failing which suitable period of extension shall be endorsed upon the acknowledgment/seizure memo by the said competent authority.
8.4. The procedure formulated by the Delhi Police and the Transport Department is fair and reasonable. Let the same be implemented forthwith.
8.5. In cases where the Suspension Order has already been passed without affording an opportunity of hearing under Section 19 (1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, and the license holder seeks a personal hearing; there is no impediment in the Motor Licensing Officer giving a fresh opportunity of hearing and passing a revised order. 8.6. There is no merit in the petitioner's plea that the suspension of a licence after the compounding of the offence would amount to double jeopardy. Section 19 can be invoked where the Licensing Authority is satisfied of the existence of conditions stipulated in Section 19(1)(a) to (h). The compounding of an offence under Section 200 of the Motor Vehicles Act does not, in any manner, affect the power of the licensing authority to suspend the licence under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The suspension of a licence under Section 19 is not dependent upon the compounding of the offence by the accused. The suspension of the licence under Section 19(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act would not, therefore, amount to double jeopardy as contended by the petitioner.
8.7. This Court hopes that the Delhi Police as well as the Transport Department of Govt. of NCT of Delhi shall follow the due process of law in implementing the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety.
8.8. In the present case, respondent no.1 has not afforded any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner as mandated by Section 19(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act and therefore, it would be appropriate to remand this matter back to respondent no.1.
9. Conclusion For the reasons discussed hereinabove, this writ petition is allowed and the case is remanded back to respondent no.1 for affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner in terms of Section 19(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Vide reply dated 27th January, 2016, the petitioner had sought better particulars, namely, date, time and place of the alleged violation. Respondent no.1 shall furnish the better particulars to the petitioner within two weeks whereupon the petitioner shall submit his response to the show cause notice within a period of two weeks thereafter. Respondent No.1 shall afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and shall thereafter pass a fresh order which shall be communicated to the petitioner. The impugned order dated 11th February, 2016 shall remain in abeyance and the petitioner would be entitled to drive till the fresh order is passed by respondent No.1. If the petitioner is not satisfied with the order that may be passed, the petitioner would be at liberty to avail the remedy of appeal before the appellate authority under Section 19 (3) of the Motor Vehicles Act.
10. The pending application is disposed of.
11. Copy of this judgment be given dasti to counsels for the parties under signature of Court Master.
