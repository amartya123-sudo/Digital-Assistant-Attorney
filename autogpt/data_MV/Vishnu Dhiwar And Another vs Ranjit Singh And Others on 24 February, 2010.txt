Chattisgarh High Court
Vishnu Dhiwar And Another vs Ranjit Singh And Others on 24 February, 2010
Miscellaneous Appeal under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 Per Prashant Kumar Mishra, J.:
The appellants had preferred a claim petition under Section 166 read with Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (henceforth `the Act, 1988') to claim compensation of Rs.11,70,000/- on the ground that deceased Ku. Jamuna was working under the employment of M/s Banjari Contractor in Monet Ispat Limited, Mandir Hasaud, Raipur as road cleaning employee. On 30-12-2005 at about 9:20 AM, respondent No.1 drove a truck bearing registration No.CG 04 J 3052 in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident driving the truck on the person of the deceased, who died on the spot. The said Jamuna was 19 years of age at the time of death.

2. The respondent/insurance company moved an application under Section 167 of the Act, 1988 submitting therein that since the claimants have already received an amount of Rs.2,33,168/-, which was deposited by the insurance company before the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation, Raipur (henceforth `the Commissioner'), the claim petition under Section 166 of the Act, 1988 is not maintainable. The claimants denied having presented an application for grant of compensation under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (henceforth `the Act, 1923') and prayed for dismissal of the application under Section 167 of the Act, 1988 filed by the insurance company.

3. The learned 1st Additional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Raipur (henceforth `the Claims Tribunal'), by the impugned order dated 27-10-2006 in Claim Case No.15/06, has allowed the insurance company's application and consequently the claim petition of the claimants has been dismissed as not maintainable.

4. The question arising for determination in this appeal is whether appellants/claimants have obtained compensation before the Commissioner and if the answer to the said question is in the affirmative, whether the claim petition under Section 166 of the Act, 1988 was maintainable.

5. The appellants have submitted order-sheets of the Commissioner recorded on 22-7-2006, 25-9-2006 and 27-9- 2006. From these orders, it is reflected that the employer had deposited the amount of compensation with the Commissioner on 31-5-2006 and for withdrawal of this amount the claimants moved an application on 15-6-2006 on which statement of the claimants were recorded and the claim petition was dismissed. Later on, a notice before disbursement of the amount was issued and it is recorded in the order-sheet dated 25-9-2006 that the claimants appeared before the Commissioner and their statements were again recorded on the said date and thereafter the amount was ordered to be disbursed to the claimants on 27- 9-2006.

6. Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the appellants/claimants never moved any application under Section 10 of the Act, 1923, therefore, it cannot be said that the claimants have opted for the proceedings under the Act, 1923. According to learned counsel for the appellants, the Claims Tribunal has wrongly rejected the claim petition under Section 166 of the Act, 1988.
7. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3/insurance company has supported the impugned order passed by the Claims Tribunal and submitted that the appellants/claimants, having already received the amount of compensation deposited with the Commissioner, their claim petition under Section 166 of the Act, 1988 is not maintainable.

8. In the present case, the insurance company had moved an application under Section 167 of the Act, 1988, which is extracted hereinbelow:

9. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Mastan and another, (2006) 2 SCC 641, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held thus:

10. Learned counsel for the appellants has argued that the appellants/claimants have not opted for the proceedings under the Act, 1923 and the claim petition under Section 166 of the Act, 1988 was filed on 31-1- 2006, almost six months prior to the application submitted by them before the Commissioner for withdrawal of the amount deposited by the insurance company before the Commissioner and thus they have opted to proceed under the Act, 1988 and not under the Act, 1923. He has relied on a Division Bench's judgment of the Bombay High Court in Shantabai Parshuram Mule and others vs. Sharda Prasadsingh and others, 1992 ACJ 270 to submit that mere acceptance of the amount deposited by the employer before the Commissioner will not amount to raise a claim under the Act, 1923. In support of his contention, he has also placed reliance on another Division Bench's judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in K.K.Jain and another vs. Masroor Anwar and others, 1990 ACJ 299 and the judgment of a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Pennamma Kurien, 1995 ACJ 760.

11. In K.K.Jain and another vs. Masroor Anwar and others (supra), the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that since the claim before the Commissioner was abandoned and not pursued by not withdrawing the amount deposited by the employer before the Commissioner, a claim petition under the Act, 1988 is maintainable. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Pennamma Kurien (supra) before the Kerala High Court, the claimants received amount under the no fault liability under the Act, 1988 and, thereafter, proceeded to claim compensation under the Act, 1923. Both these cases are, therefore, not applicable to the facts of the present case. In the case before us, the claimants have withdrawn the amount deposited by the employer before the Commissioner. The judgment rendered by the Bombay High Court in Shantabai Parshuram Mule and others vs. Sharda Prasadsingh and others (supra) may be of some assistance to the claimants, wherein it was held that mere filing of an application by the appellants for disbursement of the amount deposited by the employer before the authority constituted under the provisions of the Act, 1923 can never be treated as a claim instituted within the meaning of sub-section (5) of Section 3 of the Act, 1923 and, therefore, such act of the claimants would not disentitle them to proceed under the provisions of the Act, 1988 to claim compensation.

12. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Mastan and another (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered the doctrine of election and has held that when two remedies are available for the same relief, the aggrieved party has the option to elect either of them but not both.

13. In paragraph 27 (Per Hon'ble S.B.Sinha, J.) and paragraph 35 (Per Hon'ble P.K.Balasubramanyan, J.) of National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Mastan and another (supra), it has been held that once the respondent/claimant therein has chosen the forum under the Act, 1923 for the purpose of "obtaining" compensation and the respondent/claimant has not chosen to withdraw his claim under the Act, 1923 before it reached the point of judgment with a view to approach the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, instead, what he has done is to pursue under the Act, 1923 till the award is passed and also to invoke the provisions of the Act, 1988, the respondent/claimant is not entitled to do so.
14. In the present case also, when the employer deposited the amount with the Commissioner, the claimants moved an application for withdrawal of the amount deposited by the employer even though their claim petition under Section 166 of the Act, 1988 before the Claims Tribunal was pending. By accepting the amount of compensation deposited by the employer with the Commissioner, the claimants, though initiated a claim under the Act, 1988, would be deemed to have abandoned the said claim under the Act, 1988 and later on proceeded to receive compensation under the Act, 1923. In the light of National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Mastan and another (supra), we are not able to accept the judgment relied by the appellants/claimants decided by the Bombay High Court in Shantabai Parshuram Mule and others vs. Sharda Prasadsingh and others (supra). The appellants/claimants, in the present case, could have refused to accept the amount deposited by the employer with the Commissioner, if their intention would have been to opt for proceeding their claim under the Act, 1988. Having not done so and after having received the amount of compensation under the Act, 1923, they cannot be now permitted to proceed under the Act, 1988. The bar contained in Section 167 of the Act, 1988 is applicable and thus, the impugned order passed by the Claims Tribunal does not suffer from any infirmity.
15. In the result, the present miscellaneous appeal, being devoid of any substance, deserves to be and is accordingly dismissed.
16. No order asto costs.
