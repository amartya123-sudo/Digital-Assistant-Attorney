ORDER AR. Lakshmanan. J.
1. The order in C.R.P.No.1820 of 1992 was passed by me on 20.9.1996. Applying the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision reported in Vinod Gurudas Raikar v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. 1991 A.C.J. 1060, the accident claim of the petitioner/claimant was rejected on the ground that the same was belated.
2. While I was going through the decisions reported in 1994 (4) Supreme Court Cases, I came across the recent judgment of the Supreme Court reported in Dhannalal v.D.P. Vijayvargiva, . In that case, the Supreme Court has held that so long as the issue as to limitation for making claim prior to the 1994 amendment by a victim of an accident was pending before a Tribunal or Court, the new law will apply and any delay will have to be automatically excused.
3. In view of the above later judgment of the Supreme Court, I suo motu re-opened CR.P.P.No.1820 of 1992 and posted the same for review of my earlier order dated 20.9.1996.
4. C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 is directed by the National Insurance Company Limited against the order made in I.A.No.539 of 1991 in M.C.O.P.S.R.No.707 of 1991 on the file of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal/District Judge, Pudukkottai, condoning the delay of 213 days in filing the Motor Accident Claim Petition. Since the question involved in both the revisions is one and the same, I posted this revision along with C.R.P.No,1820 of 1992.
5. I have heard the arguments of Mr. P. Pandi, learned counsel for the petitioner in C.R.P.No.1820 of 1992 and Mr. N. Vijayaraghavan, learned counsel for the petitioner in C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 and perused the orders of the Courts below and also the various decisions cited by the learned counsel for the petitioners. There is no representation for the respondents even though they have been served.
6. In C.R.P.No.431 of 1996, the accident has occurred on 3.4.1989. The claim petition with I.A.No.539 of 1991 to condone the delay was filed on 26.9.1991. The insurance company took the defence that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to condone the delay in view of the language of Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the decision of the Supreme Court rendered in Vinod Gurudas Raikar v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., . I.A.No.539 of 1991 was disposed of on 16.8.1995 by which time the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 came to be amended by Act 54 of 1994, under which the relevant sub clause (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, stood deleted as of 14.11.1994. In I.A.No.539 of 1991, the Tribunal held that the decisions of the Supreme Court in Vinod's case , would not apply since the law has since been amended and the benefit of such amendment would enure to the benefit of pending claims also and accordingly allowed that application. Hence, C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 by the insurance company.
7. The insurance company has challenged the Tribunal's order on the following grounds:
(a) The Tribunal has grossly erred in condoling the delay of 510 days, which is contrary to Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and opposed to the decision of the Supreme Court in Vinod's case .
(b) The Tribunal ought to have seen that the claim having been filed on 26.8.1991, i.e.., prior to the amendment in Act 54 of 1994 as of 14.11.1994, and the claim having become time barred already by 26.8.1991 itself, cannot be revived by virtue of amendment in Act 54 of 1994 without a legislative intendment therein to that effect in the Motor Vehicles Act.
8. C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 was admitted by this Court on 27.2.1996 and interim stay of all further proceedings in I.A.No.539 of 1991 was initially granted for three weeks, which was subsequently made absolute. Pending disposal of this revision, the line of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal has come to be accepted by the Supreme Court itself in Dhannalal v. D.P. Vijayavargiya, .
9. While the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Vinod's case, , which was decided on 6.9.1991, had come to be reiterated in National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Swarnalatha Das, and followed by a Division Bench of this Court in Bangaru v. Dheeran Chinnamalai Transport Corporation, 1995 (II) M.L.J. 652, which was decided on 7.5.1996, the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Dhannalal's case, seems to have put a spanner in the works as it were, to the contention of the insurance company in C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 and like proceedings.
10. While the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Dhannalal's case, has been rendered by the Apex Court on 7.5.1996, even earlier one finds such views taken in Wilfred v. N.A. Maniyar, 1995 A.C.J. 673, which was decided by a learned single Judge of the Karnataka High Court on 21.4.1995.
11. In Dhannalal's case, , the Supreme Court has allowed the Civil Appeal filed before it by a victim of accident who suffered serious injuries in a road accident on 4.12.1990. The appellant became permanently disabled and has also lost his services as a driver. The claim petition was filed on 7.12.1991 along with an application for condonation of delay of four days only. The Tribunal by its order dated 18.11.1993 condoned the delay. The High Court by its order dated 31.7.1995 set aside the order of the Tribunal condoning the delay saying that in view of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the power of condonation by the Tribunal has been withdrawn and any claim must be filed within the period prescribed therein. According to the High Court, as proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 said that claims tribunal may entertain the application after the expiry of the period of six months but not later than twelve months, any application filed beyond the period of twelve months from the date of the accident cannot be entertained as no discretion had been left with the Tribunal to consider the circumstances because of which the application for claim could not be filed within the period of twelve months of the occurrence of the accident. The Supreme Court while considering the scope of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act pointed out that the aforesaid sub-section (3) of Section 166 has been omitted by Section 53 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1994, which came into force from 14.11.1994 and that there is no limitation for filing claims before the Tribunal in respect of any accident. The Supreme Court in paragraph 7 of its judgment considered the effect of omission of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act, which reads thus:
"In this background, now it has to be examined as to what is the effect of omission of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act. From the amending Act it does not appear that the said sub-section (3) has been deleted retrospectively. But at the same time, there is nothing in the amending Act to show that benefit of deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 166 is not to be extended to pending claim petitions where a plea of limitation has been raised. The effect of deletion of sub-section (3) from Section 166 of the Act can be tested by an illustration. Suppose an accident had taken place two years before 14.11.1994 when sub- section (3) was omitted from Section 166. For one reason or the other no claim petition had been filed by the victim or the heirs of the victim till 14.11.1994. Can a claim petition be not filed after 14.11.1994 in respect of such accident? Whether a claim petition filed after 14.11.1994 can be rejected by the Tribunal on the ground of limitation saying that the period of twelve months which had been prescribed when sub-section (3) of Section 166 was in force having expired the right to prefer the claim petition had been extinguished and shall not be revived after deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 166 with effect from 14.11.1994? According to us, the answer should be in negative. When sub-section (3) of Section 166 has been omitted, then the Tribunal has to entertain a claim petition without taking note of the date on which such accident had taken place. The claim petitions cannot be thrown out on the ground that such claim petitions were barred by time when sub-section (3) of Section 166 was in force. It need not be impressed that Parliament from time to time has introduced amendments in the old Act as well as in the new Act in order to protect the interests of the victims of the accidents and their heirs if the victims die. One such amendment has been introduced in the Act by the aforesaid Amendment Act 54 of 1994 by substituting sub-section (6) of Section 158 which provides:
'158(6) As soon as any information regarding any accident involving death or bodily injury to any person is recorded or report under this section is completed by a police officer, the officer in charge of the police station shall forward a copy of the same within thirty days from the date of recording of information or, as the case may be, on completion of such report to the claims tribunal having jurisdiction and a copy thereof to the concerned dinsurer, and where a copy is made available to the owner, he shall also within thirty days of receipt of such report, forward the same to such claims tribunal and insurer.' In view of sub-section (6) of Section 158 of the Act the officer- in-charge of the police station is enjoined to forward a copy of information/report regarding the accident to the Tribunal having jurisdiction. A copy thereof has also to be forwarded to the insurer concerned. It also requires that where a copy is made available to the owner of the vehicle, he shall within thirty days of receipt of such copy forward the same to the claims tribunal and insurer. In this background, the deletion of sub- section (3) from Section 166 should be given full effect so that the object of deletion of the said section by Parliament is not defeated. If a victim of the accident of heirs of the deceased victim can prefer claim for compensation although not being preferred earlier because of the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed, how the victim or the heirs of the deceased shall be in a worse position if the question of condonation of delay in filing the claim petition is pending either before the Tribunal, the High Court or the Supreme Court. The present appeal is one such case. The appellant has been pursuing from the Tribunal to this Court. His right to get compensation in connection with the accident in question is being resisted by the respondents on the ground of delay in filing the same. If he had not filed any petition for claim till 14.11.1994 in respect of the accident which took place on 4.12.1990, in view of the amending Act he became entitled to file such claim petition, the period of limitation having been deleted, the claim petition which has been filed and is being pursued up to this Court cannot be thrown out on the ground of limitation." The Supreme Court accordingly allowed the appeal filed by the claimant and set aside the order passed by the High Court and also directed the Tribunal to entertain the petition filed by the claimant and dispose of the same in accordance with law.
12. It is pertinent to notice at this stage that the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Vinod's case, was not cited before the Supreme Court.
13. Wilfred's case, 1995 A.C.J. 673, a learned single Judge of the Karnataka High Court also took the view that the effect of the partial repeal of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, by omitting sub-section (3) of Section 166 without a saving clause in favour of pending suits, is, that all proceedings pending should be disposed of as if Section 166(3) did not exist. The observations of the learned Judge in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the judgment run thus:
"We may then notice that the effect of the partial repeal of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, by omitting Section 166(3) without a saving clause in favour of pending suits is that all proceedings pending should be disposed of as if Section 166(3) did not exist. By making amendment to Section 158 and Section 166(4) the legislature has in fact done away with formal application and has visualised the claims tribunal treating the report made by the officer in-charge of the police station itself as a claim petition. Section 158 indicates that it is a mandatory duty on the part of the officer in-charge of the police station to send the report of the claims tribunal within a statutory period. In such a frame Section 166(3) is otiose.
We may also notice another aspect. Section 158 was differently worded when it was enacted in 1988. Now, by virtue of the unamended Section 158, the officer in charge of the police station after completing investigation was free to forward a copy of the report to the claims tribunal. By virtue of Section 166(4) as it originally stood, the Tribunal had discretion to treat the said report as a claim petition. If in a given case, a report as mentioned in the unamended Section 158 is received by the claims tribunal within time, and formal application filed by the claimant is received beyond 12 months of the accident, an incongruous situation may result. Hence, to avoid a possible inconsistency both Section 158 and Section 166(3) as they stood prior to the amendment cannot co-exist with Section 166(3) of the Act. Section 166(3) has to yield to Section 158 and Section 166(4) incorporated in the 1988 Act. It was apparently to achieve this result that Section 166(3) has been repealed. Hence, if the intention of the legislature is to be achieved it should be as if it did not exist at all. If so, then obviously the amendment would govern pending proceedings as well.
The amendment to Section 166(3) in made perhaps to protect people from their legitimate claim being thrown out. Then as indicated by the Supreme Court in Sree Bank Ltd, v. Sarkar Dutt Roy & Co., , while interpreting these provisions the following principle can be invoked:
'(5) Two reasons have operated on my mind to lead me to the conclusion that the general rule should not be applied in the" present case. First, it is recognised that the general rule is not invariable and that it is a sound principle in considering whether the intention was that the general rule should not be applied, to 'look to the general scope and purview of the statute, and at the remedy sought to be applied, and consider what was the former state of the law and what it was that the legislature contemplated'. (See Pardo v. Bingham, 1869 (4) Ch.A 735, at page 740). Again in Craies on Statute Law, 6th Edition, it is stated at page 395, 'If a statute is passed for the purpose of protecting the public against some evil or abuse, it may be allowed to operate retrospectively, although by such operation it will deprive some person or persons of a vested right'."
14. Both the above decisions have not only given the benefit of removal of sub-clause (3) in Section 166 to all pending claims as well, they have also been aided in their decision making by the provision in Section 166(4) read with Section 158 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, by which "the officer in charge of the police station shall forward a copy of the report of accident to the claims tribunal", and The claims tribunal shall treat any report of accidents forwarded to it under Sub-section (6) of Section 158 as an application under this Act.". In Dhannalal's case, , the Supreme Court has pronounced in clear terms that the benefit of the removal of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act shall enure to the benefit of all pending claims, be it before the Tribunal, High Courts or the Supreme Court but not to cases where any claimant having filed a petition for claim beyond time, which has been rejected by the Tribunal or the High Court, and the claimant does not challenge the same and allows the said judicial order to become final.
15. Mr. N. Vijayaraghavan, learned counsel for the insurance company, while conceding that Dhannalal's case may apply on all fours to the revision filed by the insurance company in C.R.P.No.431 of 1996, however, contends that there are possibilities to take a different point of view. Considering that the decision has come about in a motor accident claim vis-a-vis a social welfare legislation,, remote are the chances to persuade this Court to accept a different point of view.
16. While referring to the decision in Dhannalal's case, , Mr. N. Vijayaraghavan drew my attention to town significant aspects strike on while going through the decision in the said case. It is pointed out by the learned counsel that the Supreme Court has not considered the effect of Section 6(a) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, as was done in Vinod's case, 1991 A.C.J. 1060. He further contended that the Supreme Court has not considered the said legal proposition, viz., "Nothing contained in the new enactment shall enable any claim to be instituted or made under the new enactment in respect of a cause of action which had already become time barred". In other words, if a claim had already become time barred under the earlier enactment, then, even if the new enactment suggests a longer period of limitation, then, it would not have the effect of reviving such claims already time barred unless the new enactment so suggests.
17. I feel that the learned counsel for the insurance company is obviously venturing into a dangerous territory in the face of Article 141 of the Constitution. He cited the decision reported in Syed Yousuf Yar Khan v. Syed Mohammed Yar Khan, where in the Supreme Court held thus:
"We must, therefore, apply the normal rule that the law of limitation applicable to the suit is the law in force at the date of the institution of the suit."
He also cited another decision of the Supreme Court reported in C Beepathumma v. V.S. Kadambolithaya, wherein the Supreme Court has held that there is no doubt that the Law of Limitation is a procedural law and the provisions existing on the date of the suit apply to it.
18. In Vinod's case, it has been held by the Supreme Court as follows:
"So far as the period of limitation for commencing a legal proceeding is concerned, it is adjectival in nature and has to be governed by the new Act".
Hence, it is argued by the learned counsel for the insurance company, that the law of limitation which would regulate a proceeding is the Law of Limitation as it stands on the date of institution of the proceedings irrespective of whether the cause of action relating to the proceeding arose prior to the amendment, if any.
19. While in the case of substantive law, it is said retrospectivity shall not be read into a statute unless the statute so mandates, in the case of procedural law as is limitation, it is settled law that it is always retrospective in the sense, that it would apply even to causes of action which arose prior to amendment, if any, but initiated only after the amendment. This is so held by the Supreme Court in Vinod's case, . The observations of the Supreme Court run thus:
"Even independent of the General Clauses Act, it is firmly established that unless a new statute expressly or by necessary implication says so, it will not be presumed that it deprives a person of an accrued right. On the other hand, a law which is procedural in nature and does not affect the rights, has to be held to be retrospectively applicable."
20. Therefore, learned counsel for the insurance company contended that the law of limitation, which shall regulate any proceeding, shall be such law which is in force on the date of institution of such proceedings. In such circumstances only the Supreme Court had in Vinod's case, applied the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as it stood on 15.3.1990 (date of filing of the claim petition) in respect of the cause of action, viz., accident which arose on 22.1.1989 when actually the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, was in force and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, was ushered in as of 1.7.1989 alone. So construed, in C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 also the accident arose on 3.4.1989 when the 1939 Act was in force but the claim petition having been filed on 26.9.1991 when the 1988 Act alone was in force, the claim ought to be held time barred under Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. I am unable to countenance this contention in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Dhannalal's case, .
21. In so far as the contention of the learned counsel, for the insurance company relating to the effect of Section 6(a) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, is concerned, it needs mention that in Vinod's case, , the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the effect of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, while in Dhannalal's case, , it did not.
22. Under Section 217 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (after amendment as of 14.11.1994), sub-clause (4) reads thus:
"The mention of particular matters in this section shall not be held to prejudice or affect the general application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of 1897) with regard to the effect of repeals."
Hence, reference to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, according to the learned counsel for the insurance company, in appropriate and valid. The relevant Section 6(a) of the General Clauses Act reads thus:
"Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not-
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect...."
The expression used in sub-section (a) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is "anything", which is a generic term and hence, recording to the learned counsel for the insurance company, it ought to include right as well as remedy and that all rights/remedies time barred as on 14.11.1994 cannot be deemed to have been revived - Vide Act 54 of 1994.
23. In support of the above contention Mr. N. Vijayaraghavan, learned counsel for the insurance company relied on the decision reported in Naranbhai Chhaganbhai v. Motibhai Iskwarbhai, wherein in paragraph 10 it has been held as follows:
"It is quite true that there is always a difference between a right being extinguished and the remedy being barred. But when therefore we consider the effect of a repeal, it is not as if the repeal does not affect only vested rights. To hold so would be to ignore Section 6 Clause (a). Vested rights are not to be interfered with as provided in Clause (c) of Section 6. But the words of Clauses (a) are perfectly general; it does not say what will not be revived would be a right much less that the right should be one which should have been acquired. It says specifically that the repeal shall not revive anything not in force or existing at the time when the Act came to an end."
24. Learned counsel for the insurance company contended that the language in Section 6(a) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, since Act 54 of 1994 does not contain any provision for revival of time barred claims, makes it clear that the benefit of removal of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, may not accrue to claims filed under earlier dispensation -vide Section 166(3) of the Act as it stood on 1.7.1989. According to him, the claims which had been time barred by application of Section 166(3) of the Act have not got the benefit of revival under Act 54 of 1994 and it is only such of those claims which had not been time barred by 14.11.1994 may get the benefit of Act 54 of 1994. He submitted that in effect, the benefit of Act 54 of 1994 vis-avis, removal of Sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, may enure to benefit all claims which were alive as on 14.11.1994 but not those already time barred. He has also invited my attention to some decided cases on the second aspect which relates to an effect similar to that under Section 6(a) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, vis-a-vis Limitation Act, 1963. In support of this contention, he relied on the decision reported in Sachidra Nath Roy v. Maharaj Bahadur Singh, A.I.R. 1922 P.C 187 : 1922 M.W.N. 338 wherein it was held as follows:
"There is no provision in this latter Act as retrospective in its effect as to revive and make effective a judgment or decree which before that date had become unenforceable by lapse of time."
25. Mr. N.Vijayaraghavan next cited the decisions reported in Pearey Lal v. Solu Gir, AIR. 1946 All. 58 and Mangapathi Naidu v. Krishnaswami Naidu, . In the latter decision, the Madras High Court has held thus:
"It is clear, therefore that, in the absence of anything to the contrary, if a claim is within limitation according to the old Act, on the date when the new Act comes into force and a proceeding is commence, after the coming into force of the new Act, it is the new Act which would govern all decisions on the point of limitation. If, however, the right to sue or the right to apply had already been barred by the provisions of the Limitation Act then in force, then, unless there was something in the latter Act which could be deemed to apply retrospectively to revive claims which had already become time barred, the new Act could not be availed off for the purpose of saving limitation."
The statement of law made in Mangapathi Naidu v. Krishnaswami Naidu, , was accepted by a Division Bench of this Court in Ramanathan v. Kcmdappa, .
26. In the decision reported in Government of Rajasthan v. Sangram Singh, , a Full Bench of the Rajasthan High Court has held that it is a well settled proposition of law that the new law of limitation would not revive a barred right.
27. In the decision reported in Subodh Chandra v. Kavai Lal, , a Division Bench has held as follows:
"Nothing contained in the new Limitation Act shall enable any suit, appeal or application to be instituted, preferred or made, for which the period of limitation prescribed by the old Limitation Act of 1908 expired before the commencement of the new Limitation Act. In other words, if a suit, appeal or application had become time barred under the old Limitation Act of 1908, then, even though the new Limitation Act prescribes a longer period of limitation for such suits, appeals or applications, that will not have the effect of reviving such suits, appeals or applications. This is evident from Section 31 of the new Act of 1963."
28. In the decision reported in Mani Devi v. Ram Prasad, it has been held as follows:
"If the remedy was barred by the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed under the old Act of 1908 before the commencement of new Act of 1963, a longer period, if any, prescribed under the Articles of the new Act will not revive the remedy which was barred."
29. Section 31 of the Limitation Act, 1963, clearly indicates the legislative intent in these words:
"Nothing in this Act shall-
(a) enable any suit, appeal or application to be instituted, preferred or made, for which the period of limitation prescribed by the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 (9 of 1908) expired before the commencement of this Act.
(b) or affect any suit, appeal or application instituted, preferred or made before and pending at such commencement."
30. Though the above cited judgments have all uniformly held that time barred claims cannot be revived by reason of a longer period available in the new enactment, they all have held that it is always open to the legislature to mandate for its revival by a provision in the new enactment. In the absence of any contrary intention, the legal position seems to be that provision for a longer period of limitation under a new enactment may not enure to the benefit of claims already time barred but only to these claims alive, which may get a longer lease of life, as it were.
31. In so far as the time barred aspect of the claim is concerned, let us see how the Supreme Court in Dhannalal's case, has held in paragraph 7. It runs thus:
"From the Amending Act, it does not appear that the sub- section (3) of Section 166 of the Act has been deleted retrospectively. But at the same time there is nothing in the Amending Act to show that benefit of deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act is not to be extended to pending claim petitions where a plea of limitation has been raised." (Italic supplied).
32. The Supreme Court in Dhannalal's case, has construed that there is no 'negative' provision to construe time-barred claims also as revived. In that case, the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the purport and import of Sections 158(5) and 166(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, relating to report of police officers sent to claims tribunals being treated as claim petitions suo motu (a recognition by Parliament of the unique concept of public interest litigation by post card, representations, etc.). In paragraph 7, before construing the effect of removal of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the Supreme Court did refer in paragraph 6 to these provisions and began paragraph 7 with the phrase "In this background". Hence, the Court can always brush aside the concept of time barred claims by holding that in view of the power of the claims tribunal to consider such reports of police as claim petitions for compensation, no motor accident claim as of 1.7.1989, when Section 158 was introduced with Section 166(4), can be time barred as all claims are deemed to have been filed in time. It is not out of place to point out that when the Supreme Court disposed of Vinod's case, , Sections 158 and 166(4) were very much present, though not invited to the attention of the Court and argued.
33. In fact, this aspect was considered in detail with reference to Vinod's case, also, in Mer Ramde Vejananbhai v. Hardasbhai Parbhatbhai, 1992 A.C.J. 399 by the Gujarat High Court and it was held that Sections 158 and 166(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, cannot save the time barred claims. Though in Wilfred's case, 1995, A.C.J. 673, a reference was made to the question then might arise is the effect of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, but the actual effect of the expression "anything" in Section 69a) of that Act was not considered specifically at all. This judgment has gone about considering the retrospectivity of the Law of Limitation. None can argue with the proposition that the law of limitation being procedural law is always retrospective, in the sence, it would apply to all claims filed after the enforcement of the new Act, even if the cause of action had arisen earlier. But, there was no discussion in this judgment as to what is the position of time barred claims and their deemed revival by application of Act 54 of 1994 to pending claims when the new amendment contains no such provision. Even in Dhannalal's case, , the example cited in para 7 is that claims which arose two years prior to 14.11.1994 could also be filed now after 14.11.1994 since no period of limitation is now available.
34. Dhannalal's case, being on the same provision viz., Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, in my opinion, nothing much survives in C.R.P.No.431 of 1996. However, the effect of Section 6(a) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, may lead to a different conclusion read with the provision that time barred claims cannot be revived unless the new enactment so suggests. However, this question can be decided only by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and a verdict pronounced on the sustainability of these points now raised by the learned counsel for the insurance company. However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the legislation being a beneficial one intended to provide succour and relief to innocent motor accident victims, the welfare orientation given to the bestowal of benefits under Act 54 of 1994, vis-a-vis a removal of Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, may be in keeping with it.
35. The learned counsel for the insurance company urgedrthat a legally trained mind is restless when confronted with such interesting possibilities as expounded above and the exercise has been made with utmost respect to Article 141 of the Constitution. Reference has been made to the decision reported in Sree Bank Ltd., v. Sarkar Dutt Roy & Co., by the Kamataka High Court in Wilfred's case, 1995A.C.J. 673. The observations of the Supreme Court in Sree Bank Ltd., v. Sarkar Dutt Roy & Co., , have been incorporated by me in paragraph 13 supra while dealing with Wilfred's case, 1995 A.C.J. 673.
36. Learned counsel for the insurance company, in conclusion said that it is for this Court or the Supreme Court to pronounce on these interesting possibilities, as he calls them, while disposing of these revisions. According to the learned counsel, the points raised by him may at lease be referred while disposing of these two revisions. Accordingly I referred to his arguments in paragraphs supra. However, the question has not become academic so far as these revisions are concerned since Dhannalal's case, been decided on a consideration of the very provision of Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, or the effect of its removal as of 14.11.1994, which too is the subject matter of dispute in C.R.P.No.431 of 1996, nothing much may be left to be heard or decided. Where there is a direct conflict between two decisions of the Supreme Court rendered by co-equal Benches, the High Court must follow that judgment which appears to it to state the law more elaborately and accurately. As the judgment reported in Dhannalal's case, has been decided later in point of time and it also stated the law with particular reference to the very provision in Section 166(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the effect of its removal as of 14.11.1994, this later decision of the Supreme Court is follows by me.
37. For the fore-going reasons, my order dated 20.9.1996 in C.R.P.No.1820 of 1992 is set aside and instead, the Civil Revision Petition filed by the Marudhu Pandiyar Transport Corporation is dismissed in view of the latest decision of the Supreme Court in Dhannalal's case, . Had this latest decision of the Apex Court been brought to my notice earlier, I would not have allowed the revision on 20.9.1996, which necessitated me to suo motu re-open the matter and dismiss the revision petition to-day thereby reversing my earlier order dated 20.9.1996. C.R.P.No.431 of 1996 also fails and is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs in both the revisions. In view of the dismissal of both the civil revision petitions, the concerned Motor Accident claims tribunals are directed to proceed with the claim petitions in accordance with law after issuing notice to the parties concerned.
