The Civil Miscellaneous Appeal has been filed by the appellant/second respondent, against the Award and Decree, dated 22.09.2003, made in M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur, awarding a compensation of Rs.1,76,505/- together with interest at the rate of 9% per annum, from the date of filing the claim petition till the date of payment of compensation.
2.Aggrieved by the said Award and Decree passed by the Tribunal, the appellant/second respondent, the New India Assurance Co., Ltd., has filed the above appeal praying to set aside the award and decree passed by the Tribunal.
3.The short facts of the claim case is as follows:
On 16.10.2000, at about 11.00 hrs while the petitioner was travelling on the Palladam-Mangalam road and when he was in Kallampalayam, the Maruti Car bearing registration No.TNL6778, driven by its driver Kumarasamy at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner, hit against the petitioner. As a result of the accident, the petitioner sustained severe injuries. The petitioner was immediately admitted at Richmond Hospital at Coimbatore for treatment. He has been taking treatment continuously at the said hospital.
4.At the time of accident, the petitioner was a power loom worker and earning an income of Rs.5,000/- per month. Due to the accident, the petitioner sustained injuries in his hand and all over his body. Due to the injuries sustained in the accident, the petitioner has incurred permanent disability and consequent loss of earning capacity. As the accident has been caused by the driver of the maruthi car, which is owned by the first respondent and as the car has been insured with the second respondent, the petitioner has claimed a compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- from both the respondents under Section 163(A) and 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act.
5.Regarding the said accident, a criminal case has been registered at Palladam Police Station, in Crime No.659/2000.
6.The first respondent did not enter appearance and no counter was lodged by him and so he was set ex-parte.
7.The second respondent, in his Counter has resisted the claim denying the averments in the claim as regards the age, income, occupation, injuries, disability caused due to injuries, loss of earning capacity and loss of income of the petitioner. The averments in the claim regarding the manner of the accident was also not admitted by the petitioner. It has been submitted that the driver of the maruthi car drove the car at a moderate speed and in a careful manner observing all the traffic rules and regulations and that the accident was caused only due to the negligence of the petitioner. It has been submitted that the claim under various heads made in the petition was excessive. It was also submitted that the petitioner had failed to include the driver of the maruthi car bearing registration No.TN39 L6778, as a necessary party in the case. The second respondent has prayed for dismissal of the claim petition.
8.The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal framed two issues for the consideration namely:
1.Who is responsible for the accident? and whether any compensation has to be paid? If so, who is liable to pay compensation?
2.What is the quantum of compensation to be paid?
9.On the petitioner's side two witnesses were examined as PW1 and PW2 and six documents were marked as Exs.P1 to P6. On the respondents' side no oral and documentary evidence were marked.
10.The Tribunal admitted the I.A.No.604 of 2003, dated 17.07.2003, filed by the second respondent Insurance Company asking for permission to contest the case on behalf of the owner under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act and consequently the contention of the second respondent that the said car had not been insured with them was ignored since it was not sustainable under law.
11.On the first respondent's side, no Counter was filed. The second respondent in his Counter, in Para No.6, has contended that "The alleged accident had happened only due to the fault, negligence and carelessness of the petitioner and the petitioner alone."
12.As such, the Tribunal were of the opinion that the respondent has not denied the occurrence of the accident and that the petitioner had sustained injuries in the said accident.
13.The petitioner was examined as PW1. The PW1 in his evidence has stated that on 16.10.2000, at about 11 a.m. in the morning, while he was travelling on the extreme left of the Palladam-Mangalam road and from north to south and when he was nearing Kalampalayam bus stop, the vehicle bearing registration No.TN39 L6778, driven by its driver at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner had dashed against him; causing severe injuries to him. He has further stated that the accident was caused only because of the fault of the driver of the maruti car. Even on cross examination of PW1, it was found from the answers given by PW1 that no contributory negligence could be attached on the part of the petitioner in the said accident. The Tribunal were also of the opinion that no contra evidence had been furnished on the part of the respondents side to establish that the accident was not caused by the driver of the Maruthi Car bearing registration No.TN39 L6778.
14.Further, the petitioner PW1, in support of his evidence that the accident had been caused only due to the fault of the driver of the car had marked Ex.P1, the copy of FIR. It has also been stated in the FIR, that the first respondent's driver had been the cause for the accident. On scrutiny of Ex.P2, the Motor Vehicle Inspector's Report, it is seen that the accident had not been caused due to any mechanical defects in the said Car.
15.As such, the Tribunal, on considering that no contra evidence had been furnished on the respondent's side to counter the evidence given on the petitioner's side, held that the accident had been caused only due to the fault of the driver of the first respondent's car and hence held that the first and second respondents are liable to pay compensation to the petitioner.
16.The petitioner PW1 has stated in his evidence that a surgery was done on his left hand. He had further stated that due to the fracture of bones in his left wrist and fingers, he is unable to bend, stretch or lift heavy articles by using his left hand. He has further deposed that he is not able to bend the middle finger of his left hand and has stated that he had sustained permanent disability; that he was earning a sum of Rs.5,000/- per month prior to the accident as a power loom worker and that because of the accident he is not able to go for work and so he had sustained total loss of income.
17.Even after cross examination of PW1 by the respondent's side, the Tribunal was of the view that the respondent's have not established that injuries were not sustained by the petitioner in the said accident. Even during cross examination, the petitioner has stuck to his stand that he was a power loom worker.
18.The petitioner PW1 has marked Ex.P3, the Wound Certificate to prove that he had sustained injuries in the said accident. From the Wound Certificate issued by Dr.Velsasamy Ravendran, Chief Orthopaedic Surgeon of Richmond Hospital, it is seen that the petitioner has sustained a Gr.IIIA open fracture of Proximal, Phalanx with both Flexor (F.D.P & F.D.S) and Extensor tendon injury, Volar Ulna and radial digital. Nerve. Vessel laceration and the Doctor has certified that the injury sustained by the petitioner is grievious in nature.
19.The Assistant Medical Officer, Orthopaedics Section of Coimbatore Medical College Hospital was examined as PW2, regarding the assessment of injuries sustained by the petitioner in the accident. The PW2, in his evidence has stated that he had examined the petitioner on 05.07.2003, for assessing the disability sustained by the petitioner due to the injuries caused to him in the accident on 14.10.2000, based on the medical reports issued by Richmond Hospital. It is seen from the medical reports that the petitioner's middle finger had been crushed in the accident and that the nerves in this finger has lost its sensitivity and movement and treatment and surgery had been done on this finger. The Doctor has further stated in his evidence that the petitioner experiences pain in his middle finger of his left hand and that the muscles in his left hand had reduced strength. Further, the Doctor has stated that the petitioner has restricted movements in bending and stretching the fingers of his left hand and that the petitioner is unable to move his middle finger of left hand. It is also seen that there is no movement of the F.D.P.nerve and F.D.S.nerve in the left hand of the petitioner. It is further seen from the X'rays taken of the fingers; that the fractured bone in the left middle finger of the petitioner is in the process of joining and setting. The Doctor has further stated that the petitioner is unable to lift weights using his left hand and is unable to work in the power-loom factory and has certified that the permanent disability sustained by the petitioner in the accident as 25% and has stated that this disability assessed by him was as per the guidelines laid down by Dr.Ramar and on the basis of the guidelines laid down under the Workmen Compensation Act and in support of his evidence he has marked Ex.P5, the Disability Certificate and Ex.P6, X'rays. The Tribunal found that even after the cross-examination of PW2, the evidence given by him has not been found incorrect. The PW2, in support of his evidence has marked Ex.P6, the X'ray. It is visually seen from the X'ray, that the middle finger of the left hand cannot be stretched as the other fingers and that it is bent. The Doctor visually demonstrated the disability of the petitioner by trying to stretch the middle finger of the petitioner but as soon as he released his grip, the middle finger automatically dropped down. On seeing this, the Tribunal were of the opinion that the Doctor's evidence could not be rejected. Based on evidence of the PW1 and PW2 and on scrutiny of the Wound Certificate and Disability Certificate, the Tribunal held that the permanent disability sustained by the petitioner in the accident was 25%.
20.The petitioner PW1 has stated in his petition and in his chief-examination that he was working in a power loom factory. This evidence given by him has not been found untrue even during his cross-examination. The Tribunal were of the view that the petitioner could not work in the power loom due to the disability sustained by him in the accident. As such, the Tribunal were of the opinion that as the petitioner was not in a position to do his work in the power loom as he used to do before the accident, he had sustained a loss of his earning capacity and consequent loss of income. The Tribunal, on considering that it is very difficult for a worker employed in a power loom to prove his occupation through documentary evidence, held that the notional income of the petitioner could be taken as Rs.100/- per day and as Rs.3,000/- per month as per several Judgments passed by the High Court in similar cases.
21.The Tribunal on scrutiny of medical bills marked as Ex.P4 awarded a compensation of Rs.13,505/- to the petitioner under the head of medical expenses. The petitioner had stated in his petition and in his evidence that he was aged 20 years at the time of accident. On scrutiny of Wound Certificate marked as Ex.P3, it is seen that the age of the petitioner has been mentioned as 20 years. Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the age of the petitioner at the time of the accident was 20 years. Adopting a multiplier of 16 as per the Motor Vehicles Act, relevant to age of the petitioner, the Tribunal assessed the loss of income due to disability of 25% sustained by him in the accident as Rs.3,000/- X 12 X 16 X 25/100 = Rs.1,57,000/-. The Tribunal further granted an award of Rs.5,000/- under the head of grievious injuries and Rs.1,000/- was awarded under the head of nutrition. In total, the Tribunal awarded a compensation of Rs.1,76,505/-. to the petitioner and directed the respondents to jointly and severally deposit the above said award with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing the petition till the date of payment of compensation, into the credit of the M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur, within a period of one month from the date of its Order and it was further directed that after such deposit was made, the award with interest had to be invested in a nationalised bank, as fixed deposit for a period of three years and the petitioner was permitted to receive the interest on such deposit, once in six months, directly from the bank. The respondent was directed to pay the cost of Rs.7,676/- to the petitioner and the Advocate fees was fixed at Rs.6,530/-. The petitioner was directed to pay the Court fee due on the award amount within a period of one month from the date of its Order.
22.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has contended in the appeal that the Tribunal ought to have seen that excepting the Wound Certificate no other document has been produced to establish the nature of injuries suffered by the first respondent, the nature of treatment taken by him and his condition after treatment. It has also been contended that the Tribunal had awarded a sum of Rs.13,505/- for medical expenses, even when no discharge summary had been furnished and even without examining the Doctor, who gave treatment. It was also pointed out that the Doctor, who assessed the disability had based his assessment on Richmond Hospital medical records and that except for the Wound Certificate, no hospital records were produced either for verification by the Tribunal or by the appellant herein.
23.It was also contended that the learned Judge of the Tribunal was not justified in awarding a sum of Rs.1,57,000/- under the head of loss of earning power in favour of the first respondent herein, as he has suffered only non-schedule injuries for which the provisions of Section 4(1)(c)(ii) read with explanation II of Workmen Compensation Act, 1923 ought to have been invoked and the procedures contemplated under Section 20(3) of the said act ie.referring the injured person to a medical board for ascertaining the percentage of loss of earning power should have been followed. As such, it was pointed out that the disability of 25% assessed by the PW2, which has been done without issuance of any certificate of percentage of loss of earning power was erroneous and consequently the adoption of multiplier theory by invoking provisions of Section 163(A) of 2nd Schedule of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was erroneous.
24.It was also contended that the Tribunal, after having found that the disability sustained by the petitioner in the accident was 25% ought not to have determined any compensation under the head of loss of earning power and awarded a sum of Rs.1,57,000/- under the said head by applying multiplier theory as per provisions of Section 163(A) of 2nd Schedule to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as if, the first respondent herein would suffer loss of earning power to the extent of 25% throughout his life, for which there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever on record.
25.Hence, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has prayed to set aside the Award and Decree, dated 22.09.2003, in M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur and dismiss the claim petition.
25.In support of his contentions, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has cited the following Judgments:

26.The learned counsel appearing for the first respondent argued that the claimant was 20 years old at the time of accident and he was a worker in a power-loom and that after the said accident, he could not do the same job, due to injuries sustained in his fingers. Further, the nature of injuries sustained by him is permanent in nature. Supporting this point, the Doctor PW2 was examined, who also confirmed the disability through disability assessed by him. Hence, the multiplier method of compensation assessed by the Tribunal on the basis of permanent disability of 25%, in the instant case, is valid. The Tribunal, as such, had granted the above said award after considering all aspects of the case and as such it is fair and reasonable.
27.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and arguments advanced by the learned counsels on eitherside and scrutiny of case laws referred by the appellants counsel and findings of the Tribunal, this Court is of the view that the multiplier method adopted by the Tribunal for assessment of compensation, in the instant case, is erroneous. As such, this Court is of the view that it has to interfere with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal. So, this Court modifies the award passed in made in M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, dated 22.09.2003 and restructures it as follows:
1.For loss of income, considering that the claimant has 25% disability and considering that the age of the claimant was 20 years, at the time of accident, this Court awards a sum of Rs.50,000/- under the head of loss of income.
2.This Court awards a sum of Rs.10,000/- under the head of pain and suffering.
3.This Court awards a sum of Rs.5,000/- under the head of nutrition.
4.For medical expenses, a sum of Rs.13,505/- was granted by the Tribunal on the strength of Ex.P4, the medical bill series. This Court confirms the award granted under the said head.
5.As it is a fact that the petitioner's work at the power loom has been affected due to injuries in his hand and that he had sustained a loss of income for three months due to his disability in carrying out work at the power loom, this Court awards a sum of Rs.9,000/- to the claimant under the head of loss of income for three months.
In total, this Court grants an award of Rs.87,505/- to the claimant together with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing the petition till the date of payment of compensation, as it is found to be fair and equitable in the circumstances of the case.
28.On 16.03.2005, this Court imposed a condition on the appellant Insurance Company to deposit the entire compensation amount including interest and costs to the credit of the M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur.
29.As the accident happened in the year 2000, it is open to the claimant to withdraw the award amount, a sum of Rs.87,505/- together with interest at the rate of 9% per annum, lying in the credit of the M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur, after filing necessary payment out application, in accordance with law, subject to deduction of withdrawals, if any.
30.The claimant is entitled to get interest on the said award granted at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till date of payment of compensation. The appellant/Insurance Company is at liberty to withdraw the excess compensation amount, lying in the credit of the M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur, after observing necessary formalities laid by the Tribunal.
31.As such, the above said Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is partly allowed and the Award and Decree, dated 22.09.2003, in M.C.O.P.No.1309 of 2000, passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Additional District Judge-cum-Fast Track Court No.5), Tiruppur, is modified. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed. There is no order as to costs.
