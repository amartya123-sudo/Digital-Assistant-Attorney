Author: J.R. Midha
1. The parties have challenged the common impugned award whereby the compensation of `2,60,000/- has been awarded to the legal representatives of the deceased, Sanjay Kumar, `75,000/- has been awarded to the legal representatives of the deceased, Neelam and `3,50,000/- has been awarded to the legal representatives of the deceased, Sunil. The appellants in MAC.APP.Nos.541-542/2005, 545- 546/2005 and 552-553/2005 seek reduction of the award amount whereas the appellants in MAC.APP.Nos.446-449/2005, 451-454/2005 seek enhancement of the award amount.
2. The accident dated 26th March, 1999 resulted in the death of Sanjay, Neelam and Sunil and injuries to Anil and Ravi who were all travelling in Maruti Car No.DL-4C-1096 which met with an accident with DTC bus No.DL-1PA-2849.
3. Mr. J.N. Aggarwal, the learned counsel for DTC submits that Sanjay Kumar, driver of the Maruti Car No.DL-4C-1096 was contributory negligent to the extent of at least 50% and, therefore, the compensation is liable to be reduced to that extent. The learned counsel for DTC submits that half of the road was closed due to repairs and the traffic on both sides was moving on the half road. It is further submitted that the Maruti Car was overtaking the oil tanker and in the process, there was a head on collision between the Maruti Car and the DTC bus.
4. The learned Claims Tribunal has held the DTC bus alone responsible for the accident on the ground that Ravi Kumar appeared in the witness box as PW-7 and deposed that he was travelling in the Maruti Car and the DTC bus alone was rash and negligent. PW-7 denied that the Maruti Car overtook the tanker at a high speed resulting in the accident. The conductor of the bus appeared as RW-1 and deposed that the Maruti Car was negligent. However, the learned Tribunal disregarded his statement on the ground that the conductor was sitting in the back seat and he came to know about the accident only when the alarm was raised by the passengers. No statement of the passengers was recorded in the complaint book. The FIR was only registered against the driver of the bus who was arrested on the spot. Considering the statement of witnesses, this Court does not find any infirmity in the finding of the Claims Tribunal with respect to the rashness and negligence of the bus driver.

5. The deceased, Sanjay Kumar, aged 22 years at the time of the accident, was survived by his parents and two unmarried sisters. The Claims Tribunal took minimum wages of `2,348/- into consideration, added 50% towards future prospects, deducted 2/3rd towards personal expenses and applied the multiplier of 17 to compute the loss of dependency at `2,40,000/-. `20,000/- has been awarded towards loss of love and affection.
6. Mr. J.N. Aggarwal, learned counsel for DTC submits that multiplier of 13 should be taken according to the age of the deceasedâ€Ÿs mother aged 50 years. It is further submitted that only one unmarried sister is mentioned in the petition. It is further submitted that increase in minimum wages should not be taken into consideration.
7. Learned counsel for the claimants in reply submits that the deceased was survived by two unmarried sisters which is mentioned in the claim petition.
8. Learned counsel for the claimants seek enhancement of the award amount on the following grounds:-
(i) The multiplier be enhanced from 17 to 18.
(ii) The personal expenses of the deceased be reduced from 2/3rd to 1/3rd.
(iii) The compensation be awarded for loss of estate, funeral expenses and transporting the body from Agra to Delhi.
9. The deceased was survived by his parents and two unmarried sisters. In that view of the matter, the multiplier has to be taken according to the age of the deceased. The deceased was aged 22 years and the appropriate multiplier according to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation, (2009) 6 SCC 121 is 18 and the deduction towards personal expenses is 1/3rd. Following the aforesaid judgment, the multiplier is enhanced from 17 to 18 and the personal expenses of the deceased are reduced from 2/3rd to 1/3rd. However, the increase in minimum wages due to inflation is set aside. The Claims Tribunal has not awarded any compensation for loss of estate, funeral expenses and transportation of body from Agra to Delhi. `10,000/- is awarded towards loss of estate, `10,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and `15,000/- is awarded towards transportation of dead body from Agra to Delhi.
10. The appellants are entitled to total compensation of `3,93,112/- as per the break-up given hereunder:-
along with interest @9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition before the Claims Tribunal till realization. The share of the claimants in the award amount shall be equal.
12. The enhanced award amount along with interest be deposited by DTC with UCO Bank, Delhi High Court Branch by means of a cheque drawn in the name of UCO Bank A/c Babu Lal within 30 days.
MAC.APP.Nos.451-454/2005, 541-542/2005 relating to death of Neelam
13. The deceased was a housewife, aged 20 years and was survived by her father-in-law, mother-in-law and two sister-in- laws. It was claimed that the deceased was working. However, in the absence of sufficient proof, the Claims Tribunal did not consider her income and awarded `75,000/- towards compensation.
14. The Claims Tribunal has not computed the compensation in accordance with law. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lata Wadhwa v. State of Bihar, AIR 2001 SC 3218, the value of services of the deceased housewife to her family is taken to be `3,000/- per month and applying the multiplier of 18, the compensation is computed to be `6,48,000/-. `10,000/- is awarded towards loss of consortium. `5,000/- awarded towards funeral expenses be enhanced to `10,000/-. However, since the deceased is survived by her father-in-law, mother-in-law and two sisters-in- law and there is no proof of their being dependant, the compensation to them is computed as 1/3rd payable to non- dependant legal representatives in terms of the judgment of the Karnataka High Court in A. Manavalaganda vs. A. Krishnamurty, I (2005) ACC 304. The appellants are entitled to total compensation of `2,22,667/-.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, MAC.APP.No.451-454/2005 is allowed and MAC.APP.No.541-542/2005 is dismissed and the award amount is enhanced from `75,000/- to `2,22,667/- along with interest @9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition before the Claims Tribunal till realization. The share of the claimants in the award amount shall be equal.
16. The enhanced award amount along with interest be deposited by DTC with UCO Bank, Delhi High Court Branch by means of a cheque drawn in the name of UCO Bank A/c Babu Lal within 30 days.
MAC.APP. Nos. 552-553/2005 relating to death of Sunil
17. The deceased, Sunil aged 18 years was survived by his mother and unmarried sister. The deceased was a vegetable vendor. The Claims Tribunal took minimum wages of `2,348/- per month, added 50% towards inflation and rise in price index, deducted 1/3rd towards personal expenses for the first seven years and 2/3rd for the remaining nine years and applied the multiplier of 16 to compute the loss of dependency at `1,27,000/-. The Claims Tribunal awarded `25,000/- towards loss of love and affection. The total compensation awarded is `1,52,000/-.
18. Learned counsel for DTC seeks reduction of award amount on the ground that the multiplier should be applied according to the age of the mother of the deceased who was 47 years old. The claimants seek enhancement of compensation on the ground that the multiplier be enhanced from 16 to 18 and the family contribution be taken to be 1/3rd for the total period as the deceased was survived by his mother and unmarried sister.

19. It is well settled that Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Appellate Court to grant relief to a person who has neither appealed nor filed any cross- objections. The object of this provision is to do complete justice between the parties. Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been discussed time and again by the Supreme Court in the following cases:-

(i) Pannalal v. State of Bombay, AIR 1963 SC 1516.
(ii) Rameshwar Prasad v. M/s Shyam Beharilal Jagannath, (1964) 3 SCR 549.

(iv) Giasi Ram v. Ramjilal, AIR 1969 SC 1144.
(v) Harihar Prasad Singh v. Balmiki Prasad Singh, (1975) 2 SCR 932.
(vi) Mahant Dhangir v. Madan Mohan, (1988) 1 SCR 679.
(vii) State of Punjab v. Bakshish Singh, (1999) 8 SCC 222.
20. Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 empowers the Court to award such compensation as appears to be just which has been interpreted to mean just in accordance with law and it can be more than the amount claimed by the claimants. The provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 are clearly a beneficial legislation and hence should be interpreted in a way to enable the Court to assess just compensation. The scope of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the power of the High Court to enhance the award amount in accident cases in the absence of cross- objections has been discussed by the Supreme Court in Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh, AIR 2003 SC 674 where the Apex Court has held that the Court is required to determine just compensation and there is no other limitation or restriction for awarding such compensation and in appropriate cases wherefrom the evidence brought on record if the Tribunal/Court considers that the claimant is entitled to get more compensation than claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award and would empower the Court to enhance the compensation at the appellate stage even without the injured filing an appeal or cross-objections.
21. The scope of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure in motor accident cases has been exhaustively discussed in the following three High Court judgments:-
(i) In National Insurance Company v. Rani, 2006 ACJ 1224, the Division Bench of Madras High Court held as under:-
(ii) In Oriental Fire And General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Amarsing Pratapsing Sikliker, I (1993) ACC 627, the Division Bench of Gujarat High held as under:-
(iii) In Prakramchand v. Chuttan, AIR 1991 MP 280, the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court held as under:-
22. Considering that the deceased left behind the mother and unmarried sister, the multiplier has to be applied according to the age of the deceased. The deceased was aged 18 years and the appropriate multiplier according to the judgment of Sarla Verma (supra) is 18 and the appropriate deduction towards personal expenses is 1/3rd. Following the aforesaid judgments, the multiplier is enhanced from 16 to 18 and the personal expenses of the deceased are taken to be 1/3rd for the entire period. The increase in minimum wages due to inflation is set aside. The Claims Tribunal has not awarded any compensation for loss of estate and funeral expenses. `10,000/- is awarded towards loss of estate and `10,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses.
23. The appellants are entitled to the total compensation of `3,83,112/- as per the break-up given hereunder:-
However, the award amount is enhanced from `3,50,000/- to `3,83,112/- along with interest @9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition before the Claims Tribunal till realization. The share of the claimants in the award amount shall be equal.
