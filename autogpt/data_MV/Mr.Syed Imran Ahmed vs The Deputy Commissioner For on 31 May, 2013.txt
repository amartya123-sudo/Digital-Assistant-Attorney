Karnataka High Court
Mr.Syed Imran Ahmed vs The Deputy Commissioner For on 31 May, 2013
Author: Aravind Kumar
Heard Sri B R Sundararaja Gupta, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners and Sri K M Shivayogiswamy, learned Government Advocate appearing for respondents. Perused the case papers.
2. Petitioners are seeking for quashing of the orders passed by first respondent dated 22.03.2013 produced at Annexures-G & D respectively and they are also seeking for quashing of the notice of demand dated 01.10.2012 issued by second respondent pursuant to same at Annexures-D & B respectively.

3. Petitioners are the registered owners of the Stage Carriage Vehicles operated in the state of Karnataka on the strength of Special Permits issued by second respondent-RTO under Section 88(8) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'MV Act'). The said vehicles are having seating capacity of 49+1=50 and 48+2=50 respectively. The vehicle belonging to the petitioner in W.P.No.15387/2013 was originally registered and classified as stage carriage and subsequently altered from stage carriage to contract carriage with effect from 17.09.2010. The vehicle in W.P.21790/2013 is registered and classified as Stage Carriage. Respondents issued demand notices to the petitioner demanding tax pursuant to the audit observation noticing that lower rate of tax has been levied and recovered, though higher rate of tax was required to be levied and collected for the period 24.01.2003 to 28.02.2008 in respect of vehicle bearing No.KA 02/9349 (in W.P.No.15387/2013) and for the period 2008-09 to 2001-11 in respect of vehicle bearing No.KA-46/4959 (in W.P.21790/2013).

4. Petitioner in W.P.No.15387/2013 had approached this Court in W.P.No.13754/2009 being aggrieved by such demand notice and consequential notices issued thereto contending interalia that there is violation of principles of natural justice since said demand had been raised without hearing the petitioner. This Court by order dated 25.05.2009 had disposed of said writ petition directing the petitioner to treat the demand notice as show cause notice and to file reply to it and thereafter respondents were directed to pass orders in accordance with law. Likewise, petitioner in W.P.No.21790/2013 had also approached this Court questioning the demand notice issued to him in W.P.No.33637/2012 and on the lines of the order passed in W.P.No.13754/2009 said writ petition also came to be disposed of on 05.09.2012. The said orders are at Annexure-A in both the petitions. Accordingly both the petitioners filed their reply and prayed for proceedings being dropped.

5. Subsequently respondent vide demand notice dated 25.06.2012 once again raised a demand on petitioner in W.P.No.15387/2013. As such said petitioner approached this Court in W.P.No.24674/2012 alleging that there has been non-compliance of earlier direction issued by this Court in W.P.No.13754/2009. Hence, this Court, by order dated 06.08.2012 set aside the demand and remanded the matter to the respondent for reconsideration in accordance with law after considering the objections filed by the petitioner. Thereafter objections filed by petitioner came to be considered by respondent authorities and an endorsement dated 01.10.2012 (Annexure-D) came to be issued. Likewise petitioner in W.P.No.21790/2013 was issued with similar notice of demand dated 01.10.2012 (Annexure-B). Under these endorsements a demand for difference of tax in a sum of ` 1,95,249/- and ` 1,16,776/- came to be raised against both the petitioners.

6. Being aggrieved by these endorsements, both the petitioners filed appeals under Section 15 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 before first respondent herein in Appeal Nos. 06/2012-13 and 04/2012-13 respectively. Both these appeals came to be dismissed by orders dated 15.02.2013 and 22-03- 2013 vide Annexures-E and D respectively. It is against these orders petitioners are before this Court seeking for quashing of the same.

7. It is the contention of Mr.Gupta, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners that under Section 88(8) of the MV Act, petitioners have obtained special permits and are running the vehicles in question and the said vehicles are used as stage carriage and not as a contract carriage and as such, demand raised by treating vehicles in question as contract carriage vehicles is liable to be set aside. He would draw the attention of the Court to Rule 151(2) of Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 to contend that operation of vehicles in question was after obtaining Special Permits as contemplated Under Section 88(8) of M.V. Act, hence item 5(b) of Part A of the Schedule to Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 is attracted and item 5(a) (i) of Part A of the schedule is not attracted and as such, demand raised by the respondent is erroneous. He would contend that under Section 72 of the MV Act, no stage carriage permit has been obtained by the petitioners but Special Permit under Section 88(8) of M.V.Act 1988 has been obtained and hence vehicles in question cannot be construed as contract carriage vehicles. In support of his submission, he has relied upon the following judgments:
1. 1975(1) Kar.L.J 395 - SRMS TOURIST SERVICE CO. vs. SECRETRY, RTA
2. 1979(2) Kar.L.J 292 - K.N.SREEKANTAIAH vs DEPUTY TRANSPORT COMMISSIONER, BANGALORE & ANOTHER
8. Per contra, Sri Shivayogiswamy, learned Additional Government Advocate would vehemently contend that vehicles in question having been registered as a stage carriage, during the undisputed period of time were being used as a contract carriage and petitioners had not obtained permit as a stage carriage though it was registered as such and in view of Special Permit having been obtained under sub-section (8) of Section 88 of MV Act and vehicles having been used as contract carriages, it would fall under item 5(a)(i) of part A of Schedule to the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 and as such he justifies the demand raised by the respondents. In support of his submission, he has relied upon the judgment in the case of NATWAR PARIKH & CO.LTD vs STATE OF KARNATAKA & OTHERS reported in (2005) 7 SCC 364 to buttress his argument that it is the use of motor vehicle which would be the determining factor to ascertain under which item of the Schedule-A of Taxation Act it would fall and it is not the category of the permit which has been obtained which would determine the taxability and such permit would be necessary only for the purpose of plying the vehicle and nature of permit has no bearing insofar as levy of tax under the MV Act.

9. Having heard the learned Advocates appearing for parties and on perusal of the order/endorsement issued by the second respondent as affirmed by the appellate authority, it requires to be noted that under the MV Act, 1988 the category of vehicles have been described as under:

10. A 'stage carriage' permit is granted to a vehicle under Section 72 of the MV Act, 1988 subject to provisions of Section 71 on an application made under Section 70 of MV Act. Under sub-section (8) of Section 88 of MV Act, 1988 the Regional Transport Authority of any one region or the State Transport Authority as the case may be for the convenience of public, is empowered to grant a "special permit" to any public service vehicle including any vehicle covered by permit issued under Section 72 or Section 74 or under sub-section (9) of section 88 for carrying a passenger or passengers for hire or reward under a contract, express or implied, for the use of the vehicle as a whole without stopping to pick up or set down along the line of route not included in the contract.

11. Section 3 of Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 which is the charging section provides for levy of tax on all motor vehicles which are suitable for use on roads. The rate of taxation is as provided to under Part-A of Schedule and relevant entries which are having bearing to the facts of the present case are extracted herein below:
In case of the vehicle being plied after obtaining special permit issued under Section 88(8) of MV Act, higher rate of tax requires to be paid as contemplated under Section 8 of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act by the registered owner or by the person who is in possession or control of such vehicle.

12. In the instant case vehicles in question at the undisputed point of time were registered and classified as "Stage Carriage" vehicles and tax was determined under entry 4(3)(a) and tax was paid @ 550/- (for every seat/per quarterly). Since petitioners had obtained 'Special Permits' under Section 88(8) of the M.V.Act, 1988 it was classified under entry 5(b) and determined the tax payable @ 770/- and the difference of ` 220/- was paid i.e., ` 770/- (-) ` 550/- = ` 220/-. However, it was noticed by the department that vehicles in question though registered as "Stage Carriage" there was no such permit obtained, but on the other hand these vehicles were being used on road as a "Contract Carriage" after having obtained Special Permit under Section 88(8) of the M.V.Act, 1988 and for the vehicles used as a contract carriage, entry 5(a)(i) is attracted and hence tax payable for the relevant period under said entry being ` 1000/- (for every seat/per quarter) and the cess of 10%, the sum total being ` 1,100/- (for every seat/per quarter) the petitioners have been called upon to pay the difference of ` 330/- i.e., ` 1100/- (demanded) less ` 770/- (advance paid) as tax due.
13. The Apex Court in the case of NATWAR PARIKH & CO. LTD., vs STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS reported in (2005) 7 SCC 364 has held that it is the use of motor vehicle on a given occasion which would determine the category of motor vehicle, whether it is adapted for the said purpose or not for taxation. It has been held as under:

14. Keeping the principles laid down in NATWAR PARIKH's case above referred, facts on hand requires to be considered. In the instant case, vehicles have been registered as 'stage carriage' as per Registration Certificate issued by the jurisdictional Regional Transport Authority. Undisputedly said vehicles were not having any stage carriage permit granted under Section 72 of the Motor Vehicles Act. However, these two vehicles have been plied by the respective petitioners by obtaining special permits under sub- section (8) of Section 88 of the MV Act. Special permits were granted under the Motor Vehicles Act for the purpose of plying the vehicles on road and such permits cannot be the barometer for purposes of levy and collection of tax. It is the nature of use of the vehicle which determines the taxability.

15. The judgment of a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in SRMS TOURIST SERVICE CO. referred to supra relied upon by learned Advocate appearing for petitioners would have no application to the facts on hand for the simple reason that in the said case, petitioner and others had applied to the Secretary, Regional Transport Authority of their respective jurisdiction for grant of special permits for a couple of days to carry tourists from place to place by invoking 63(6) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 which provision is in analogous and in pari materia with Section 88(8) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Said applications came to be rejected solely on the ground since there is a scheme published under Section 68 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 proposing to nationalize the contract carriages throughout state to the exclusion of other operators. It is in this context, it has been held that a special permit in relation to a public service vehicle granted under Section 63(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 does not fall within the meaning of a 'contract carriage permit'. In the instant case, petitioners having obtained special permits under sub-section (8) of Section 88 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 have made an attempt to draw sustenance in the light of law laid down in SRMS TOURIST SERVICE CO's case to contend that same yardstick requires to be applied even in respect of petitioners' vehicles while being considered for levying tax under the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 and this is what Hon'ble Apex Court has held to be impermissible in NATWAR PARIKH's case referred to supra namely, it has been held that it is the use of the vehicle which determines the taxability and not the nature of permit issued to a vehicle. Petitioners' vehicles are no doubt registered as contract carriages and they have not obtained permit under Section 72 of MV Act, 1988, but on the other hand they have taken out periodically Special Permits under Section 88(8) of MV Act, 1988 and plied the vehicles as 'Contract carriages'. Hence, the nature of permit issued to the vehicles in question recedes to background insofar as levy of tax on said vehicles. Hence, I am of the considered view that decision in SRMS TOURIST SEVICES CO. will have no application to the facts on hand and it would not come to petitioners' assistance.

16. It is also not in dispute that vehicles in question had at no point of time plied after obtaining either 'stage carriage permit' or a 'contract carriage permit'. On the other hand, at all points of time petitioners plied them as 'Contract Carriages' by periodically obtaining Special Permits under sub-section (8) of section 88 of the M.V. Act, 1988. Thus, nature of use of the vehicle would be the fact which determines the leviability of tax in respect of a vehicle and nature of permit obtained for plying the vehicle would not be the determining factor for tax leviable in respect of such vehicle. In view of the dicta laid down by the Apex Court in NATWAR PARIKH's case referred to supra that it is the manner and nature of use of the vehicle which would be the determining factor for levy of tax and this aspect regarding nature of use of vehicle not having been considered by the Division Bench in SRIKANTAIAH's case relied upon by petitioners counsel, the principles enunciated therein would not assist the petitioners to the facts on hand, as such, I am not inclined to accept the contention raised by Sri BRS Gupta.

17. It would emerge from the aforesaid discussion that vehicles in question which neither had permits obtained under Section 72 or 73 of MV Act, 1988 and which were being exclusively run as 'Contract Carriages' having obtained Special Permits under Section 88(8) of MV Act and continuously used as a contract carriage, respondents were justified in levying tax by invoking item 5(b) of Part A of Schedule to Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 and demanding difference of tax as contemplated under Section 8 of Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957. Hence, I do not find any good ground to interfere with the findings recorded by the appellate authority which are in consonance with the statutory provisions. For the reasons aforesaid, it is held that there is no merit in the contentions raised in these petitions.
Writ Petitions are hereby dismissed as being devoid of merits. No costs.
