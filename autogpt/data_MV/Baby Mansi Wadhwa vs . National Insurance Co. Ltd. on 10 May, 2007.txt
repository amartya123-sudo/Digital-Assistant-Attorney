Issue No.1 shall be answered in common for both the said petitions, whereas Issue No. 2 & 3 shall be dealt with separately in the said two petitions.

Page : 7 Suit No. 252/06 My findings issue wise are as under:-
ISSUE NO. 1:- (IN BOTH THE PETITIONS) Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides Special provisions as to payment of compensation on structured formula basis. It reads as :
Section 163A . Special Provisions as to payment of compensation on structured formula basis. -(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force or instrument having the force of law, the owner of the motor vehicle of the authorised insurer shall be liable to pay in the case of death or permanent disablement due to accident arising out of the use of motor vehicle, compensation, as indicated in the second Schedule, to the legal heirs or the victim, as the case may be.
Explanation:- ..................................................................................
On careful perusal and analysis of the entire evidence on record I find that the petitioner has proved the involvement of the two wheeler scooter no. DL-8SD-4550 in the accident resulting in the death of deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa and deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa (Sh. Vimal Wadhwa, father of deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa and husband of deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa had also expired in the said accident).
Page : 8 Suit No. 252/06 PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa and PW 3 ASI Samander Singh have proved the copies of the documents of the criminal case record prepared by the IO during the course of investigation Ex. PW 1/2 to PW 1/6 and Ex. PW 3/1 to PW 3/6.

The perusal of the documents prepared by the police during the course of investigation : FIR Ex. PW 1/2 (also Ex. PW 3/3), site plan Ex. PW 1/3 (also Ex. PW 3/4), Driving Licence of Vimal Wadhwa (since deceased) Ex. PW 1/4, copies of RC and insurance policy of scooter no. DL- 8SD-4550 Ex. PW 1/5 and Ex. PW 1/6 respectively, untraced report under section 173 CrPC Ex. PW 3/1, rukka Ex. PW 3/2, seizure memo of the scooter no. DL-8SD-4550 Ex. PW 3/5, mechanical inspection report of the scooter no. DL-8SD-4550 Ex. PW 3/6, indicate the involvement of the scooter no. DL-8SD-4550 in the accident.

The fact that deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa and Smt. Seema Wadhwa suffered fatal injuries has been proved by the postmortem reports of Master Abhay Wadhwa Ex. PW 2/A (also Ex. PW 1/8) and postmortem report of Smt. Seema Wadhwa Ex. PW 2/B (also Ex. PW 1/7). The postmortem reports Ex. PW 2/A and PW 2/B inter-alia read that all injuries are antemortem in nature and injuries are caused by blunt force impact consistent with being involved in vehicular accident. Death is due to Cranio- Cerebral injuries. Further R-1 has not disputed the factum of sufferance of fatal injuries by Master Abhay Wadhwa and Smt. Seema Page : 9 Suit No. 252/06 Wadhwa (and also of Vimal Wadhwa) in the said accident.
In view of the above and in the circumstances, it stands established that the deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa and deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa suffered fatal injuries in the said accident caused due to the involvement of the two wheeler scooter no. DL-8SD-4550.
Accordingly, Issue no. 1 is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents.
ISSUE NO.2 :- (IN PETITION No. 251/2006) PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa in her affidavit of examination-in- chief Ex. PW 1/A has deposed that her grand son Master Abhay Wadhwa was a student and was 6 years old. During her cross-examination by Ld. counsel for respondent, PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa has deposed that she has not filed any date of birth certificate to prove the age of her grand son Master Abhay Wadhwa and she has not filed any document to show that her grand son was a student of six years old.

Admittedly no documentary evidence has been proved on record with regard to the age of the deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa. The perusal of the postmortem report of the deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa Ex. PW 2/A (also Ex. PW 1/8) shows the age of the deceased Master Abhay Page : 10 Suit No. 252/06 Wadhwa as 6 years. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary on the record, I take that deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa was a child of age 6 years at the time of accident and was a student and was a non earning person.

Having held so, I am left with no other option but to apply the criteria of Notional Income of non-earning persons as set out in the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. As per Clause -6 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the notional income of non-earning person as Rs. 15,000/- p.a has been estimated. Accordingly, I take the income of the deceased as Rs. 15,000/- p.a. at the time of the accident.
In my this view I am fortified as to what has been held in case titled Manju Devi & Another Vs. Musafir Paswan & Another 2005 ACJ 99, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court had assessed notional income for a non-earning person, a deceased boy age 13 years at Rs. 15,000/- p.a. as stipulated in the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Reliance also placed on Shyam Narayan Vs. Kitty Tours Travels & Ors. IV (2005) ACC 1 (Delhi High Court) (Hon'ble Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog).

In Manju Devi's case (Supra) in Para No. 2 & 3 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:-

Page : 11 Suit No. 252/06
2. In the case of U.P. State Road Trans. Corpn. v. Trilok Chandra, 1996 ACJ 831 (SC), it has been held by this court that there should be no departure from the multiplier method on the ground that payment being made is just compensation. It has been held that the multiplier method must be accepted method for determining and ensuring payment of just compensation as it is the method which brings uniformity and certainty to awards made all over the country. In view of this authority, it will have to be held that the award of compensation had to be made by the multiplier method.
3. As set out in the Second Schedule to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for a boy of 13 years of age, a multiplier of 15 would have to be applied. As per the second Schedule, he being a non-earning person, a sum of Rs. 15,000/- must be taken as the income. Thus, the compensation comes to Rs. 2,25,000/-.

At the cost of repetition the deceased Master Abhay Wadhwa was a child of six years and was a student and was a non-earning person.
Next question arises as to what should be the multiplier applicable to the present case. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Manju Devi's case (Supra) and as held by Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Shyam Naryan's case (Supra) as set out in Clause-6 of the Second Schedule to the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the proper and appropriate multiplier applicable to the present case is "15". Thus the total loss of dependency to the petitioner comes to Rs. 2,25,000/- (Rs. 15,000/- X 15).
A sum of Rs. 2,000/- is awarded to the petitioner towards Funeral Expenses. Thus the petitioner is entitled to a total compensation of Rs. 2,27,000/- on account of the death of the deceased resulting from the said accident.
Page : 12 Suit No. 252/06 Next question arises as to from whom the petitioner is entitled to receive the said awarded amount of compensation. R-1 being the insurer of the vehicle in question (as the insured Sh. Vimal Wadhwa had already died in the said accident) is held vicariously liable to pay the said awarded amount of compensation to the petitioner.

Here one contention of R-1 needs to be discussed. Ld. counsel for R-3 submitted that the insured Sh. Vimal Wadhwa, since deceased, had not paid any extra premium for covering the risk of pillion rider or of the passenger and on the death of the insured Personal Accident Claim covered under the policy had been paid and after payment of the said claim to the insured, the policy stood cancelled and the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation.

While Ld. counsel for petitioner has controverted the submissions of Ld. counsel for respondent.
I have carefully considered the submissions of Ld. counsel for the parties.

Respondent / NIC has examined R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal, A.O. National Insurance Co. Ltd. D.O. No. 4 Darya Ganj, New Delhi.
Page : 13 Suit No. 252/06 I have carefully perused the testimony of R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal. In the testimony of R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal, the factum of accident involving two wheeler scooter no. DL-8SD-4550 insured vide policy Ex. R1W1/A, has not been disputed by the respondent. R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal in his examination-in-chief has deposed that as per the premium schedule as per page 2 of the policy, the insured has not paid any extra premium for covering the risk of the pillion rider or passenger. While during his cross examination by the Ld. counsel for petitioner, R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal admitted it to be correct that in the schedule of the premium at Point-X, T.P. of Rs. 160/- has been charged from the insured and has voluntarily stated that T.P. means Third Party / some other person and to a specific question that what does he mean by T.P. / Third Party, R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal has deposed that Third Party means person other than the insured. In the circumstances, a futile attempt has been made by the respondent by propounding a theory that on the death of insured, after the payment of Personal Accident Claim to the insured covered under the policy, the policy stands cancelled and company is not liable to pay any compensation. But the bottom of the said theory has been knocked out by R1W1 as to what he has deposed during his cross-examination as mentioned herein above, at the cost of repetition by admitting that in the schedule of premium at Point-X T.P. of Rs. 160/- has been charged from the insured and T.P. means Third Party / some other person and Third Party means the person other than insured.

Page : 14 Suit No. 252/06 Moreover, no evidence has been led on the record by the respondent that after the payment of the Personal Accident Claim to the insured covered under the policy, the policy shall stand cancelled despite charging of the amount towards the T.P. (Third Party) from the insured in the schedule of the premium. Further, the respondent has not made a single whisper in its entire written statement in this regard.
Section 155 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for effect of death on certain causes of action.

It reads as :-

155. Effect of death on certain causes of action.- Notwithstanding anything contained in section 306 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (39 of 1925), the death of a person in whose favour a certificate of insurance had been issued, if it occurs after the happening of an event which has given rise to a claim under the provisions of this Chapter, shall not be a bar to the survival of any cause of action arising out of the said event against his estate or against the insurer.
At the cost of repetition it is the admitted case of R-1 that the two wheeler scooter No. DL-8SD-4550 was insured in the name of Sh. Vimal Wadwa vide policy Ex.R1W1/A valid w.e.f 19.03.2004 to 18.03.2005 and the said insurance policy was valid at the date of the accident on 29.05.2004.
In view of above, I do not find any substance in the submissions as made by the Ld. counsel for respondent that insurance Page : 15 Suit No. 252/06 company is not liable to pay the awarded amount of compensation. Accordingly respondent / NIC is held vicariously liable to pay awarded amount of compensation to the petitioner.

Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents.
ISSUES NO. 2 IN PETITION NO. 252/2006.

PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa in her affidavit of examination-in- chief Ex. PW 1/A has deposed that Smt. Seema Wadhwa was her daughter in law and was a tutor and was earning Rs. 15,000/- per annum (Notional Income).

During her cross-examination by the Ld. counsel for respondent, PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa has denied the suggestion that her daughter in law was not doing any tution work.

Admittedly no documentary evidence has been proved on record with regard to the occupation, income and educational qualification of the deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa. As such I am left with no other option but to apply the criteria of Notional Income of non-earning persons as set out in the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. As per Clause -6 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the notional income of non-earning person as Page : 16 Suit No. 252/06 Rs. 15,000/- p.a has been estimated. Accordingly, I take the income of the deceased as Rs. 15,000/- p.a. at the time of the accident.
PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa in her affidavit of examination-in- chief Ex. PW 1/A has deposed that decease Smt. Seema Wadhwa was 38 years of age. During her cross-examination by Ld. counsel for respondent, PW 1 Smt. Krishna Wadhwa has deposed that she has not filed any date of birth certificate to prove the age of her daughter in law.
Admittedly no documentary evidence has been proved on record with regard to the age of deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa. Postmortem report of the deceased Ex. PW 2/B (also Ex. PW 1/7) shows that her age has been mentioned as 38 years. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary on the record to the said age of 38 years of deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa as shown in postmortem report Ex. PW 2/B, I take that deceased Smt. Seema Wadhwa was 38 years of age at the time of accident.
Taking guidance from the Second Schedule to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the proper and appropriate multiplier applicable to the present case is "16". Thus the total loss of dependency to the petitioner comes to Rs. 2,40,000/- (Rs. 15,000/- X 16).
A sum of Rs. 2,000/- is awarded to the Petitioner towards funeral expenses. Thus the petitioner is entitled to a total compensation of Page : 17 Suit No. 252/06 Rs. 2,42,000/- on account of the death of the deceased resulting from the said accident.

Next question arises as to from whom the petitioner is entitled to receive the said awarded amount of compensation. R-1 being the insurer of the vehicle in question (as the insured Sh. Vimal Wadhwa had already died in the said accident) is held vicariously liable to pay the said awarded amount of compensation to the petitioner.

Here one contention of R-1 needs to be discussed. Ld. counsel for R-3 submitted that the insured Sh. Vimal Wadhwa, since deceased, had not paid any extra premium for covering the risk of pillion rider or of the passenger and on the death of the insured Personal Accident Claim covered under the policy had been paid and after payment of the said claim to the insured, the policy stood cancelled and the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation.

While Ld. counsel for petitioner has controverted the submissions of Ld. counsel for respondent.
I have carefully considered the submissions of Ld. counsel for the parties.

Page : 18 Suit No. 252/06 Respondent / NIC has examined R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal, A.O. National Insurance Co. Ltd. D.O. No. 4 Darya Ganj, New Delhi.
I have carefully perused the testimony of R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal. In the testimony of R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal, the factum of accident involving two wheeler scooter no. DL-8SD-4550 insured vide policy Ex. R1W1/A, has not been disputed by the respondent. R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal in his examination-in-chief has deposed that as per the premium schedule as per page 2 of the policy, the insured has not paid any extra premium for covering the risk of the pillion rider or passenger. While during his cross examination by the Ld. counsel for petitioner, R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal admitted it to be correct that in the schedule of the premium at Point-X, T.P. of Rs. 160/- has been charged from the insured and has voluntarily stated that T.P. means Third Party / some other person and to a specific question that what does he mean by T.P. / Third Party, R1W1 Shiv Raj Kawal has deposed that Third Party means person other than the insured.

But the bottom of the said theory has been knocked out by R1W1 as to what he has deposed during his cross-examination as mentioned herein above, at the cost of repetition by admitting that in the schedule of premium at Point-X T.P. of Rs. 160/- has been charged from the insured and T.P. means Third Page : 19 Suit No. 252/06 Party / some other person and Third Party means the person other than insured.

Moreover, no evidence has been led on the record by the respondent that after the payment of the Personal Accident Claim to the insured covered under the policy, the policy shall stand cancelled despite charging of the amount towards the T.P. (Third Party) from the insured in the schedule of the premium. Further, the respondent has not made a single whisper in its entire written statement in this regard.

At the cost of repetition it is the admitted case of R-1 that the two wheeler scooter No. DL-8SD-4550 was insured in the name of Sh. Vimal Wadwa vide policy Ex.R1W1/A valid w.e.f 19.03.2004 to 18.03.2005 and the said insurance policy was valid at the date of the accident on 29.05.2004.
Page : 20 Suit No. 252/06 In view of above, I do not find any substance in the submissions as made by the Ld. counsel for respondent that insurance company is not liable to pay the awarded amount of compensation. Accordingly respondent / NIC is held vicariously liable to pay awarded amount of compensation to the petitioner.

Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents.

The petitioner is also entitled to be compensated for the delay in getting the compensation. Accordingly, I allow an interest @ 7.5% p.a. as per the rate of interest allowed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case reported as "Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs.
