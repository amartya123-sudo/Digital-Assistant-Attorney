Kerala High Court
Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
Kurian Joseph, J.
Whether the Permanent Lok Adalat constituted under Section 22B of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') has jurisdiction to entertain a claim for compensation under the provisions of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is the question to be considered in these cases. The learned Single Judge has held that the Permanent Lok Adalat under Section 22B of the Act has no such jurisdiction and hence the appeal. (The decision of the learned Single Judge is reported in New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Jameela WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 2 (2009(1) KLT 153). Since the same issue was pending before the learned Single Judge in other writ petitions, those cases also have been tagged along with the appeal.
2. Permanent Lok Adalat is a new concept introduced under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, by Act 37 of 2002. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 was enacted to constitute Legal Services Authorities for providing free and competent legal service to the weaker sections of the society to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities, and to organize Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity. The source of inspiration and the obligation is Article 39A of the Constitution of India, which reads as follows:-
litigation adalat. In that background, it was thought that at least in the case of disputes pertaining to notified public utilities, designated Lok Adalat can be given the jurisdiction to decide the disputes involving a property dispute and valued upto Rs.10 lakhs WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 4 in the event of the parties failing to reach a settlement despite the conciliation and Chapter VI-A was introduced by way of an amendment comprising of Sections 22A to 22E. Section 22A deals mainly with the definition of public utility service, which reads as follows :-
Section 22B provides for establishment of permanent Lok Adalath which reads as follows :-
22B. Establishment of Permanent Lok Adalats.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 19, the Central Authority or, as the case may be, every State Authority shall, by notification, establish WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 5 Permanent Lok Adalats at such places and for exercising such jurisdiction in respect of one or more public utility services and for such areas as may be specified in the notification.
(2) Every Permanent Lok Adalat established for an area notified under sub-section (1) shall consist of--
(a) a person who is, or has been, a district judge or additional district judge or has held judicial office higher in rank than that of a district judge, shall be the Chairman of the Permanent Lok Adalath; and
(b) two other persons having adequate experience in public utility service to be nominated by the Central Government or, as the case may be, the State Government on the recommendation of the Central Authority or, as the case may be, the State Authority, appointed by the Central Authority or, as the case may be, the State Authority, establishing such Permanent Lok Adalat and the other terms and conditions of the appointment of the Chairman and other persons referred to in clause (b) shall be such as may be prescribed by the Central Government. Section 22C deals with cognizance of cases by Permanent Lok Adalat, which reads as follows:-

) shall communicate any document or statement received by it from any party to the application to the WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 7 other party, to enable such other party to present reply thereto.
(4) When statement, additional statement and reply, if any, have been filed under sub-section (3), to the satisfaction of the Permanent Lok Adalat, it shall conduct conciliation proceedings between the parties to the application in such manner as it thinks appropriate taking into account the circumstances of the dispute.
(5) The Permanent Lok Adalat shall, during conduct of conciliation proceedings under sub-section (4), assist the parties in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute in an independent and impartial manner.
(6) It shall be the duty of every party to the application to cooperate in good faith with the Permanent Lok Adalat in conciliation of the dispute relating to the application and to comply with the direction of the Permanent Lok Adalat to produce evidence and other related documents before it.
(7) When a Permanent Lok Adalat, in the aforesaid conciliation proceedings, is of opinion that there exist elements of settlement in such proceedings which may be acceptable to the parties, it may formulate the terms of a possible settlement of the dispute and give to parties concerned for their observations and in case the parties reach at an agreement on the settlement of the dispute, they shall sign the settlement agreement and the Permanent Lok Adalat shall pass an award in terms thereof and furnish a copy of the same to each of the parties concerned.
(8) Where the parties fail to reach at an agreement WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 8 under sub-section (7), the Permanent Lok Adalat shall, if the dispute does not relate to any offence, decide the dispute.
4. As far as regular Lok Adalat under Chapter VI is concerned, the cognizance is under Section 20 coming under Chapter VI which reads as follows :-

section (1) of Section 19 may, on receipt of an application from any one of the parties to any matter referred to in clause (ii) of sub-section (5) of Section 19 WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 9 that such matter needs to be determined by a Lok Adalat, refer such matter to the Lok Adalat, for determination :
Provided that no matter shall be referred to the Lok Adalat except after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the other party.
(3) Where any case is referred to a Lok Adalat under sub-section (1) or where a reference has been made to it under sub-section(2), the Lok Adalat shall proceed to dispose of the case or matter and arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties.
(4) Every Lok Adalat shall, while determining any reference before it under this Act, act with utmost expedition to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties and shall be guided by the principles of justice, equity, fair play and other legal principles.
(5) Where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no compromise or settlement could be arrived at between the parties, the record of the case shall be returned by it to the court, from which the reference has been received under sub-section (1) for disposal in accordance with law.
(6) Where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no compromise or settlement could be arrived at between the parties, in a matter referred to in sub-section (2), that Lok Adalat shall advise the parties to seek remedy in a court.
(7) Where the record of the case is returned under sub-section (5) to the court, such court shall proceed to deal with such case from the stage which was reached before such reference under sub-section(1). WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 10 The essential difference between Section 20 Lok Adalat and Section 22B Lok Adalat is that in the former the Lok Adalat has to make an attempt to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties guided by the principles of justice, equity, fair play and other legal principles, whereas in the latter, the Permanent Lok Adalat has to conduct conciliation proceedings between the parties in such a manner as it thinks appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the dispute. In the process, the Permanent Lok Adalat has to make an attempt to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute in an independent and impartial manner. The Permanent Lok Adalat has thereafter to formulate the terms of the possible settlement of the dispute and the parties agreeing for the terms of settlement as formulated by the Lok Adalath, should sign the settlement, and Permanent Lok Adalat passes an award in terms of the settlement. Despite all the attempts for conciliated settlement, in case Permanent Lok Adalat fails to reach an agreement as above, the Permanent Lok Adalat is given jurisdiction to decide the dispute, if the dispute does not relate to an offence and of course WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 11 subject to the monetary value of property being below Rs.10 lakhs. Under Section 22D of the Act, it has also been prescribed that in the conciliation proceedings or in deciding a dispute on merits, the permanent Lok Adalat shall be guided by the principles of natural justice, objectivity, fair play, equity and other principles of justice. The award thus passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat is also having the status and force of the decree.
5. Under Section 22B of the Act, the Permanent Lok Adalat has jurisdiction only in respect of one or more of public utility services as defined under the Act. The dispute in the instant case is as to whether under the notified public utility service-Insurance Service, the permanent Lok Adalat can entertain and decide a dispute relating to a claim for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. The expression `Insurance Service' is not defined under the Act. The expression `service' is defined under Section 2(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which reads as follows:-
Thus Insurance Service can be understood as a service of any description which is made available to potential users, and includes facilities in connection with insurance. `Deficiency' has also been defined under Section 2(1)(g) as "any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance which is required to be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or has been undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise in relation to any service." As far as a claim before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal is concerned, it is a claim for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of a third party so arising, or both. In Dhulabhai v. State of M.P. (AIR 1969 S.C.
78), the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the question of WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 13 jurisdiction of the special Tribunals. It has been held that "Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals the civil courts' jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what the civil court would normally do in a suit. Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure". Thus when a statute creates a special tribunal, only that special tribunal has the jurisdiction to deal with those matters for which the Tribunal is constituted and no other forum, unless the power is specifically conferred on it. No doubt, under Section 25 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, the Act has an overriding effect. Section 25 of the Act reads as follows :-
But it has to be seen that the Act itself was introduced for imparting legal service and for organizing Lok Adalats to secure WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 14 that the operation of the legal system promotes justice. That justice is justice in accordance with law. Under law, the very concept of Lok Adalat is compromise or settlement. There is no decision by the Adalat. However, Chapter VI-A has been introduced by Act 37 of 2002, providing for "pre-litigation conciliation and settlement". To refer to the statement of objects and reasons of the Amending Act 37 of 2002, it is seen that the Amending Act was intended only to petty cases pertaining to public utility services where there is need for urgent settlement of the disputes so that people get justice without delay even at pre- litigation stage. Paragraph 2 of the statement of objects and reasons of the Amending Act 37 of 2002 reads as follows :-

6. The scheme of functioning of the Permanent Lok Adalat as envisaged in the Act would show that it is not intended for adjudication. It is intended to settle the disputes through conciliation. After following the elaborate procedure in the matter of conciliation and settlement of the dispute, in case the parties fail to reach an agreement in respect of the terms of possible settlement as formulated after conciliation, then alone the Permanent Lok Adalat is given power to decide the dispute. In this context, it would be profitable to refer to the bench decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court reported in Union Territory, Chandigarh v. Permanent Lok Adalat & Another [AIR 2009 (NOC) 496 (Punjab & Haryana)]. It has been held in the WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 16 said decision at paragraph 8 as follows :-
It has also been held at paragraph 9 as follows :-

Such disputes are not intended to be decided by the Permanent Lok Adalat. Permanent Lok Adalats are not alternative courts but have been established to provide immediate relief to the aggrieved citizens against the inaction or wrongful action of the authorities dealing with public utility service in day to WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 17 day life. The present dispute is beyond the scope of Permanent Lok Adalats."(emphasis supplied) In United India Insurance Company Limited v. Ajay Sinha and another [(2008)7 Supreme Court Cases 454], the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the scope of the Permanent Lok Adalat. It has been held therein that "With respect to public utility services, the main purpose behind Section 22-C(8) seems to be that most of the petty cases which ought not go in the regular courts, would be settled in the pre-litigation stage itself." As far as adjudication of claims for compensation is concerned, every claim will have to be considered on merits and on an adversarial basis, the compensation will have to be fixed. That jurisdiction has been exclusively conferred on the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals set up under Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The Supreme Court in Chairman, Thiruvalluvar Transport Corporation v. Consumer Protection Council [1995(2) Supreme Court Cases 479] considered the question as to whether the Forums under the WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 18 Consumer Protection Act had jurisdiction to deal with claims for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. It has been held at paragraph 6 of the judgment as follows :-
Therefore, it is fairly clear that once the special tribunals under Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 have been set up for deciding the claims for compensation arising out of the use of the motor vehicle, no other forum has jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims, unless such power is duly and specifically conferred on those Forum.
7. Then the question is whether "insurance service" as notified under Section 22A of the Act would take in the claims against insurance companies, who have indemnified the owner of the motor vehicle. We do not think that any elaborate discussion WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 19 is required to answer the question in the negative since the service of insurance under Chapter VI-A of the Act is one of the public utility services. The Supreme Court in United India Insurance Company Limited v. Ajay Sinha and another (supra) has held that "Ordinarily, insurance service would not come within the public utility service. But having regard to the statutory scheme, it must be held to be included thereunder. It is one thing to say that an authority is created under a statute to bring about a settlement through alternate dispute resolution mechanism but it is another thing to say that an adjudicatory power is conferred on it." In view of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Tribunals set up under Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to adjudicate motor accident claims it has to be held that the insurance service contemplated under Section 22A of the Act would only take in grievance on deficiency in service rendered by insurance companies to the policy holders. Adjudication of claims for compensation on account of motor vehicle accident is outside the purview of the Permanent Lok Adalat for public utility services. Thus we find it difficult to agree with the view to the contra taken by the Jharkhand High Court in National Insurance Company Ltd., v. Vijay Kumar Sharma and others (2009 ACJ 403). With great respect, we may also note that there are no detailed discussions on these aspects in the above decision.
8. For the above reasons, we do not find any merit in WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 20 the writ appeal. The Permanent Lok Adalat does not have jurisdiction to entertain claim petitions for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Therefore, we dismiss the writ appeal and allow the writ petitions, quashing the impugned orders. Learned counsel for the Insurance Companies submit that they filed the writ petitions only on principle and except in the case of impugned orders in W.P.(C) Nos.5887 and 9687 of 2009, they are prepared to pay the money, treating the cases as duly settled between the parties. In view of the above submission, there will be a direction to the Insurance Companies to pay the amounts as per the impugned orders, except in W.P.(C) Nos.5887 and 9687 of 2009 to the respective claimants, treating the claims as duly settled.
9. Before we part, we may note that Chapter VI-A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 has been introduced for pre-litigation conciliation and settlement. Any dispute before taking the shape of a litigation should be attempted to be conciliated and settled at the pre-litigation stage, to the extent permitted under Chapter VI-A of the Act. Under Chapter VI, Lok WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 21 Adalats are constituted for compromise and settlement. The Permanent Lok Adalat is manned by a person who has been a District Judge or Additional District Judge or a Judicial Officer higher in rank than that of a District Judge as Chairman and two other persons having adequate experience in public utility service. In case the District Legal Services Authority or for that matter, the Kerala State Legal Services Authority is able to organise a regular Lok Adalat under Section 19 of the Act by making use of the service of the Chairman of the Permanent Lok Adalat, it would be a great help to the people and Insurance Companies, since 75% of the claims can be settled at the pre- litigation stage, in case the Insurance Companies and parties cooperate. We are aware that the Kerala State Legal Services Authority has taken steps to organise such a regular Lok Adalat under Section 19 of the Act making use of the service of the Chairman and members. Therefore, it will be open to the parties who intend to file claim petitions before the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunals in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta Districts to first approach the Permanent Lok WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 22 Adalat, Thiruvananthapuram, where there is also a regular Lok Adalat in terms of Section 19 of the Kerala Legal Service Authorities Act for those districts. Similarly, in the matter of other disputes also other than a case or matter relating to an offence not compoundable under any law, falling within the jurisdiction of the three districts, the parties are free to approach the same Lok Adalat for settlement or compromise. In the event of such petitions being received in the Adalat, steps shall be taken promptly to see whether a settlement is possible. Such steps shall be completed within six months from the date of receipt of the petitions. If a settlement is arrived at, the Adalat shall pass awards and in case there is no settlement, the parties shall be informed to pursue the matter before the respective Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals/respective Tribunals/Courts.
10. It is brought to our notice that though the Government had proposed three Permanent Lok Adalats- Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode, only the one at Thiruvananthapuram was established. We direct the Government to set up the remaining two at Ernakulam and Kozhikode within WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 23 four months. A copy of this judgment shall be communicated to the Chief Secretary forthwith.
