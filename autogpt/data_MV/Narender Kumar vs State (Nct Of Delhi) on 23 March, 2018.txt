Hence, the present revision is disposed off on the basis of the record and the submissions of the Ld. Addl. PP for the State and the convict himself.

Explanation: - For the purposes of this section, the drug or drugs specified by the Central Government in this behalf, by notification in the Official Gazette, shall be deemed to render a person incapable of exercising proper control over a motor vehicle.
9. It is a settled law that if accused is found guilty for more than one offences, a separate sentence is to be awarded for each and every offence. Perusal of the TCR shows that Ld. MM has imposed a fine of Rs.500/- for offence U/s 3/181 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a fine of Rs.1,000/- for offence U/s 146/196 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a fine of Rs.2,000/- for offence U/s 185 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a fine of Rs.1,000/- for offence U/s 115/190(2) of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and a fine of Rs.100/- for offence U/s 129/177 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Thus, a total fine of Rs.4,600/- was imposed which was also paid by the convict. The TCR thus, reflects that separate sentences for fine were passed for separate offences.
10.One of the ground on which the present revision petition has been filed is that the Ld. Trial Court has failed to appreciate that the accused has pleaded guilty for the offences levelled against him and no FSL report was filed by the police, however, the breath analyzer report was available on record, moreover, the accused had pleaded guilty for the offences voluntarily. It is also stated in the revision that the petitioner was not aware about the consequences of pleading guilty as he had appeared for the first time in the court.

However, TCR reveals that he was assisted by Ld. Counsel Mr. M.G. Salahuddin. He was also explained all the allegations by the Ld. Trial Court and had voluntarily pleaded guilty to the offences levelled against him. His voluntary plea was accepted by the Ld. Trial Court and on his plea of guilt he was convicted. Therefore, this ground of revision that the petitioner was not aware about the consequences of pleading guilty is not acceptable at all. In my view, the Ld. Trial Court has rightly observed that as the accused was driving the vehicle after taking huge amount of alcohol, without having driving license, without insurance, without helmet and without pollution certificate, only the punishment of fine would not have a deterrent or reformative effect on the convict. In my view, sentence for four days of simple imprisonment is not harsh in such circumstances. Also, as the Ld. MM has passed separate sentence for separate offences, I do not find any illegality in the order of the Ld. MM.
11.In view of the above discussions, present revision petition is, thus, dismissed being not maintainable and is hereby disposed off accordingly. Copy of this order be sent to the Ld. Trial Court, TCR be sent back. Revision file be consigned to record room.
