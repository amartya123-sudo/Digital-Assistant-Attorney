Punjab-Haryana High Court
Dcm Textiles Hissar vs Union Of India And Ors on 23 February, 2017
The petitioner company has sought a direction to register its vehicles as non-transport vehicle after treating them as private service vehicles. It has also sought the setting aside of memo dated 14.09.2004 to the extent directions have been issued by the State Transport Controller, Haryana to register the vehicles in the name of the petitioner as transport vehicles. A writ in the nature of certiorari for setting aside entry No.(x) in the notification issued by the Central Government on 05.11.2004 to the extent that only private service vehicles registered in the name of an individual to be treated as non-transport vehicle and a mandamus to respondents No.2 to 4 to renew the registration of the vehicle without charging any passenger tax and refund of tax already paid have also been sought.
2. The petitioner company registered in the name of DCM Textiles, Hisar is stated to have purchased three vehicles i.e. two Mahindra Boleros and one Eicher 10.90 L. These vehicles are used for fetching employees from their 1 of 13 residence to the petitioner's textile mill. It is the case of the petitioner that these vehicles are not being used for any hire or reward or for any commercial purpose and are therefore, covered under the definition of private service vehicle under Section 2(33) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
3. A challenge has been made to the notification dated 05.11.2004 to the extent of classifying only the vehicles owned by individuals to be non- transport vehicles while the vehicles which are owned by a company are treated as transport vehicles and subjected to passenger tax. The petitioner company had earlier preferred CWP No.1871 of 2015 claiming somewhat similar reliefs as claimed in the instant petition which was disposed of by a Division Bench of this Court on 07.09.2015 with a direction to respondents to pass a speaking order on the representation of the petitioner company. The representation of the petitioner has been rejected by the order dated 04.11.2015 passed by respondent No.5 which has also been impugned in this petition.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner company has contended that the classification of private service vehicle as non-transport and transport vehicle by treating only the vehicles registered in the name of individuals and owned by an individual to be non-transport vehicle is contrary to the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 inasmuch as the Act only refers to registration of vehicles in the name of an owner and does not make any distinction between an individual or any juristic person including a company. The term 'owner' includes both individual as well as company and cannot be further classified. Learned counsel also contended that the vehicles which are being used by the company are not for any commercial purpose but for the purpose of ferrying its employees from their places of residence to the mill. No fare is being charged from the employees. The vehicles are exclusively used by the company for its efficient functioning and not for any commercial purpose and therefore, it 2 of 13 cannot be treated as a commercial purpose whatsoever, to exclude it from the classification of non-transport vehicle as in the case of an individual owner and such a classification in the notification dated 05.11.2004 is arbitrary and discriminatory and it is thus liable to be struck down.
5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents has contended that the scheme of the Motor Vehicles Act provides for classifying the vehicles as public and private service vehicles as well as transport and non- transport vehicles. The Motor Vehicles Act read with the Punjab Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1952 extended to the State of Haryana empowers the state government to levy passenger tax on the transport vehicles and therefore, the action of the respondents in this regard cannot be faulted.
6. It is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of Section 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the notification dated 05.11.2004 which are set out hereinafter:-
8. The classification of vehicles owned by an individual for private use and vehicles used for hire or reward is valid. There is an intelligible differentia between purely private use and commercial use of vehicles. Similarly there is an intelligible differentia between purely private use of a vehicle and use of vehicles for carrying persons in connection with the trade or business. There does not seem to be anything illogical or illegal in such a classification.

9. Consequently there does not appear to be any doubt that the petitioners' vehicles which are stated to be carrying employees in connection with trade and business would fall in the category of private service vehicle as defined in sub section 2(33). Once the petitioners' vehicles fall in the category of private service vehicle, it is axiomatic that it would fall in the category of 7 of 13 transport vehicle. Therefore, the petitioners' vehicles being categorized in the entry (xi) of notification dated 05.11.2004 is correct and we do not find it to be arbitrary or illegal in any manner whatsoever.

10. Insofar as classifying the vehicles owned by individuals as non- transport vehicle is concerned, it is clear from the afore-mentioned four categories of vehicles classified in sub Section 2 (47) that the vehicles owned by individuals do not fall in these four classes of vehicles categorized in Section 2(47). We, therefore, do not find any merit in the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the vehicles of the petitioner should be categorized as non- transport vehicles as in the case of vehicles owned by individual owners. The vehicles of the petitioner are being used to ferrying its employees from their residence to the mill. Indisputably, the company of the petitioner is carrying out business or commercial ventures. The work of the employees who are being transported in these vehicles is directly in relation to the commercial purpose of the company. On the contrary, the vehicles owned by individuals for their personal use would be at an altogether different footing. They are not carrying any commercial activity as is being done in the case of the petitioner company while transporting its employees to the mill. We thus, do not find any arbitrariness or discrimination in the distinction carved out in the notification dated 05.11.2004 in the case of individuals who are using the vehicles for their personal use.

11. We now advert to the liability of the petitioner to pay the passenger tax which is also impugned in the instant petition. The relevant provisions of Punjab Passenger and Goods Taxation Act, 1952 are set out hereinafter:-
13. It is the case of the petitioner that there is a different mode/rate of taxation for transport and non-transport vehicles and its vehicles have been subjected to passenger tax at higher rates. Although the details are not set out in the petition we proceed on the basis that the vehicles owned by individuals would be taxed at lower rates than the vehicles of the petitioner company. The definition of 'passenger' in Section 2(f) of the Punjab Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1952 includes any person travelling in a motor vehicle but excludes driver, conductor or an employee of an owner travelling in discharge of his duties in connection with the vehicle.

14. We do not find any infirmity in treating the employees of the petitioner company as passengers under the Punjab Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1952 and subjecting the company to passenger tax. The passengers including the employees who are being ferried from their residence to the mill cannot be taken out of the ambit of the definition of the passengers. The definition excludes only driver, conductor or an employee in discharge of duties in connection with the vehicle which could well be cleaner etc. but not 12 of 13 the officials of the company who do not have any connection with the vehicle. Section 3(1) itself includes within its ambit the petitioners' vehicles. The employees of the petitioner company are included in Section 2(f). Therefore we cannot accept the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that its employees who travel in its vehicles to the mill are not passengers.
15. Further, bare reading of Section 3 indicates that tax is to be calculated as percentage of fare. Fare has been defined in Section 2(c) which includes sums payable for a season ticket or in respect of the hire of a contract of carriage. In the explanation to Section 3(1) it is set out that even when passengers are carried by motor vehicle and no fare is charged the tax shall be levied and paid as if such passengers are carried at the normal rate fixed by the competent authority. Therefore, merely because the petitioner company does not charge its employees does not mean fare cannot be computed. It has to be computed as per the explanation to Section 3(1). Fare can be levied on passengers carried by a motor vehicle other than a private carrier. The employees of the petitioner are passengers. The vehicles of the petitioner company are motor vehicles and not private carriers which carry goods etc. Therefore, they would squarely fall in Section 2(i).

16. For these reasons we do not find any illegality in classifying the petitioners' vehicles as transport vehicles and charging passenger tax thereon.
17. In the result the petition stands dismissed.
