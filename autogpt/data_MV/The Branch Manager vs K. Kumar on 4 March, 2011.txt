2.The short facts of the case are as follows:
On 22.11.1991, at about 05.30 p.m., the claimant after ploughing his land and while he was returning in the tractor, bearing Registration No.TN-25-2891, which was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner, the tractor capsized. In the result, the claimant had sustained grievous injuries. Hence the compensation petition was filed against the respondent for a sum of Rs.1 Lakh with interest. The second respondent had filed a counter statement and resisted the Claim Petition. The respondent stated that the claimant had fallen down from the vehicle and due to this, he had sustained injuries. The claimant had also received compensation of a sum of Rs.1,700/- from the second respondent, on 17.07.1992. After that, the Claim Petition has been filed. The third respondent had filed a counter statement stating that on 22.11.1991, at about 05.30 p.m., when the tractor was returning from the land, after ploughing, it capsized due to rash and negligent driving of the first respondent and this was denied . The insurance particulars had not been furnished. The respondent further stated that the first and second respondent had colluded with the applicant and claiming compensation against the third respondent. At the time of accident, the driver was not in possession of a valid driving licence. The claimant had also not travelled in the tractor. The age and income of the claimant are denied. The respondent further stated that, as per the investigator's report, the driver was not possessing a valid driving licence.
3. On pleading of both parties, the Tribunal had framed two issues for consideration, viz.,:-
 1. Did the first respondent commit the accident in a rash and negligent manner?
2. Whether the claimant is entitled to receive compensation? If so, what is the quantum of compensation?
4. On the side of the claimant, one witness was examined i.e., the claimant and four documents were marked. On the side of the respondents, R.W.1, was examined and investigator's report was filed. The marked documents of the claimant are as follows:-
1.F.I.R.
2.Hospital records
3.Motor Vehicle Inspector's Report
4.Judgment copy of the Criminal Court.
5. P.W.1 has adduced evidence stating that the accident had occurred on 22.11.1991, at about 05.30 p.m. He further stated that the first respondent's rash and negligent driving was the cause of the accident. In order to prove the accident took place, F.I.R. was marked. P.W.2, doctor, stated that he had examined the claimant on 22.11.1991 at about 11.45 p.m. He further stated that the claimant had sustained injuries on his left leg. In order to prove the same, the claimant marked Ex.P.2, the medical records. On considering the evidence of the witnesses, the Tribunal had awarded a compensation of a sum of Rs.85,000/- with interest at the rate of 9%.
6. Aggrieved by the said award, the Insurance company has filed the above appeal.
7. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation since the driver of the tractor was not possessing the valid driving licence. The charge sheet clearly established that the first respondent has been charge sheeted under Section 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act for driving the vehicle. The first respondent had also pleaded guilty to the charges framed against him. The second respondent has not contested the case and he has remained ex parte. As per the policy conditions, the Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation as the claimant is an unauthorised passenger. Further, the compensation amount is on the higher side, since the claimant had sustained only minor injuries. The learned counsel has cited Judgments, which reads as follows:-
i) National Insurance company Limited Vs. V. Chinnamma and others (2004 ACJ 1909):-
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, Section 147 (1) (prior to its amendment in 1994)  Motor insurance  Goods vehicle  Passenger risk  Liability of insurance company  Death of passenger travelling in tractor  trailer along with his bags of vegetables when he fell down  Accident occurred in 1991  Whether the insurance company is liable  Held: no; insurance for owner of goods or his authorised representative travelling in a vehicle became compulsory only from the date of coming into force of 1994 amendment. (2003 ACJ 1 (SC) followed).

ii) Branch Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited vs. Nagammal and others (2009 (1) TN MAC 1 (FB)):-
 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, Sections 147, 149(4) & 149 (5)  Gratuitous Passengers travelling in Goods vehicle  Liability of Insurer  Extent  Under Section 147 Insurer not statutorily required to cover liability in respect of passenger in goods vehicle unless such passenger is owner of goods or agent of owner of goods accompanying such goods in goods vehicle  In absence of any statutory requirement to cover liability in respect of passenger in goods vehicle, principle of pay and recover as statutorily recognized in Sections 149 (4) & 149 (5) not applicable ipso facto  Therefore, ordinarily Court not expected to issue direction to Insurer to pay to claimant and thereafter to recover same from owner  Where, relying upon decision in Satpal Singh, Tribunal directed Insurer to pay compensation, Appellate Court required to consider as to whether such direction could be set aside in its entirety or liability should be fastened only on driver and owner or whether Insurer should be directed to comply with direction to pay & recover  No such direction can be issued by Tribunal after decision in Baljit Kaur's case, merely because date of accident was before such decision  Date of accident is immaterial  However, where matter already decided by Tribunal before decision in Baljit Kaur, it would be in discretion of Appellate Court depending upon facts and circumstances of case, whether doctrine of pay and recover to be applied or not.
8. The learned counsel for the claimant argued that the claimant had sustained injuries due to the accident, while he was walking on the road. At that time, the first respondent had driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. The same was established by way of F.I.R. and charge sheet. The driver pleaded guilty. The learned counsel in support of his case, cited a Judgment, which reads as follows:-
i) The New India Assurance Company Limited, Tirunelveli Vs. Chandran and another (2010 (2) TCJ 342):-
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988:- Section 147  Statutory requirement to cover the liability  Gratuitous passengers claimed compensation  Tribunal passed a common order awarding compensation  Appellant contending that the Insurance Company is not statutorily required to cover the liability in respect of a passenger in a goods vehicle.
High Court held:- It would be in the decision of the appellate Court, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case, whether the doctrine of Pay and recover should be applied or as to whether the claimant would be left to recover the amount from the person liable  All the persons travelled in the tempo van are villagers and they belong to the poorest Section of the Society  Insurance Company has to pay the compensation at the first instance and thereafter, they could be permitted to recover the amount from the vehicle owner  Appeals are disposed of. Therefore, the claimant is entitled to receive compensation for sustaining an injury in the said accident.
9. The learned counsel for the second respondent/owner of the vehicle argued that there was no discussion about the driving licence and also no discussion on the first respondent's driver had a valid driving licence at the time of the accident. The driver was not examined and the second respondent was also not examined regarding the driving licence issue. The Regional Transport Officials were also not examined to prove that the driver did not have a valid driving licence at the time of accident. In the absence of documentary and oral evidence, pay and recovery is not applicable against the owner of the vehicle. Therefore, the second respondent driver is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant.
10. The learned counsel further argued that the case was not registered under Section 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Supporting his argument, he had marked the following decisions:-
i) Ashok Gangadhar Maratha Vs. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. ((1999) 6 SCC 620):-

11. On considering the facts and circumstances of the case and after hearing the arguments advanced by the learned counsel on either side of the parties concerned and on perusing the impugned decision of the Tribunal, this Court is of the considered opinion that in the impugned award, there was no findings as to whether or not the claimant was a gratuitous passenger.

In the said accident, the claimant had sustained injuries.
