20. The Honourable Supreme Court in State of A.P. and others versus B. Noorulla Khan and another (2004) 6 SCC 194 has brought out a clear distinction between a “contract carriage” and “stage carriage” as defined in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. In this connection, a reference may be made to paragraph 16 wherein the distinction has been explained as under:-
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 16 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
21. As per Section 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles TaxationAct, 1974 tax shall be levied on every motor vehicle used or kept for use in the State of Tamil Nadu at the rate specified in the First schedule to Ninth schedule as the case may be. Thus, ordinarily, the petitioner is required to pay tax under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974.
22. In W.P.Nos.76 to 78, 13875, 13924, 20536, 20624 and 20628 of 2001 this Court vide its Order dated 17.01.2006 under a somewhat similar circumstances, held that the there is a liability for every motor vehicle which is used by or kept for use in the State of Tamil Nadu to pay tax”. Operative portion of the said order reads as under:-
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 17 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
23. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of B.A.Jayaram and Others etc Vs. Unionof India and Others, 1984 1 SCC 168 observed as follows:
24. The petitioner has relied on “permit” and “authorization” issued to the petitioner under All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021.
25. The All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 was framed under the power vested with the Central Government under Section 88 and Section 89 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 in suppression of Motor Vehicles (All India Permit For Tourist Transport Operators) Rules, 1983.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 18 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
26. The expression “Authorisation” and “Permit” is used in Rule 3 of All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation Or Permit) Rules 2021. It reads as under:
Rule 3:- Application for authorisation or permit:
5. The application along with the specified fee shall be made in electronic form on the website of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways i.e.
6. The Transport Authority shall issue the authorization or permit, as the case may be, ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 19 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of application.
27. To avail the benefit of the above Rule, the petitioner’s bus should be “tourist vehicle” and the petitioner should be a “tourist vehicle” operator. Rule 4(4) of All India Tourist Vehicle (Authorization or Permit ) Rules 2021 deals with the procedure for grant of Authorisation” or “Permit” and renewal thereof:-
28. The aforesaid rule also prescribes the fee for issuance of “Authorisation” or “Permit”. It reads as under :
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 20 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 S.No. Cateogry of Tourist Authorization Air Conditioned Permit Non-Air Conditioned vehicle hile as per Fee(in Rupee) Fee (in Rupees) Permit Fee (in passenger capacity Rupees) (Annualy) (Annualy) excluding driver (Annualy)
1. Less than nine 500 25,000 15,000
2. Ten or More but less than 750 75,000 50,000 twenty three
3. Twenty Three or more 1000 3,00,000 2,00,000 (2) The rates for quarterly permit shall be thirty percent of the fee specified in sub-rule (1):
Provided that in case where the Transport Authority is other than the Jurisdictional Transport Authority in which the operator has its registered address or the vehicle is registered,an additional charge of one hundred rupee in case of authorisation and one thousand rupees in case of permit shall be charged for issuance of authorization or permit, as the case maybe.
29. Rule 2 (b) and (d) of the All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 define these expressions “Authorisation” and Permit as follows:-
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 21 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 Rule 2 (b) Rule 2 (d) "Authorisation" means an "Permit" means a permit issued by the authorisation granted by the Transport Transport Authority to enable a tourist Authority to enable tourist vehicles vehicle operator/owner to ply tourist vehi- operator owner to ply tourist vehicle cle throughout the territory of India with- throughout the territory of India out payment of taxes or fee levied by the subject to the payment of taxes or State or Union territory through which it fees, if any, levied by the State or plies: Union territory through which it plies:
30. Thus, petitioner should have used the bus as a “Contract Carriage,” to avail the benefit of All India Tourist Vehicles ( Authorisation or Permit) Rule 2021.
31. The “Permit” and “Authorisation” referred to in the All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 applies only to the “Tourist Vehicles” as defined in Section 2(43) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. as is evident from a reading of Rule 3 of the aforesaid Rules.
32. As per Rule 6 of the All India Tourist vehicle (Authorization or Permit ) Rules 2021, the fee paid towards authorization or permit as the case may be shall be remitted on a monthly basis to the jurisdictional ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 22 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 state. The permit fee collected under rule 5 is to be distributed among the States and Union Territories. Rule 16 of the All India Tourist vehicle (Authorization or permit ) Rules 2021 deals with exemption with which this court is not concerned
33. The usage of the vehicle, whether as a “Contract Carriage” and “Stage Carriage” is one of fact. It cannot be determined by this Court.
Though in the affidavit the petitioner has stated that the petitioner’s vehicle was used as “Tourist Vehicle” it is not clear whether it was indeed used as “Tourist Vehicle” by the petitioner.
34. When the bus was impounded vehicle necessary information would have been gathered by the fourth and fifth respondent. as to whether the impounded bus was used by the petitioner as a “Contract Carriage” or as a “Stage Carriage”. The counter indicates that the petitioner had used the bus as a “ contract carriage”.
35. If the vehicle was used by the petitioner as a “Stage Carriage” in the State of Tamil Nadu, there is no question concession of the ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 23 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 “Authorisation” and “Permit” issued to the petitioner under the provisions of the All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 by the Nagaland Government.
36. In S.Thirumoorthy & P.Tamilselvi vs. The Union of India, this Court vide its order dated 18.10.2021 in W.P.No.19949 of 2021 has held as under :-
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 24 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
10. The Rajasthan High Court, while dealing this aspect has held as follows:
6. It is difficult to imagine that if the imposition of tax on vehicles is a subject matter of State List, how the Central Government can frame the Rules regarding imposition of tax in this respect.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 25 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
7. It is evident from the record that whatever may be the sanctity of the Minutes of meeting dated 24.4.92 (Annexure-4). the State of Rajasthan has not amended the provisions of the Act, 1951.
8. More so, as referred to above, there can be no dispute regarding the legal proposition that as the tax on such vehicles is leviable only by the State Government, the Central Government cannot frame the Rules for imposition of such tax. (Vide Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharadkur Jayanlikumar Pasawalla & Co., AIR 1992 SC 2038. It can merely persuade the State Government to amend its Act/Rules/ notification prescribing the said “composite fee” for vehicles covered by the said Scheme. But unless the State accepts it, the concept of composite fee remains unenforceable.”
11. I fully concur with the view of the learned Judge and I am of the view that the questions raised by the petitioners herein are answered and covered by the said decision. The Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles,. Act, 1974 imposes a levy of tax on motor vehicles In the state of Tamil Nadu. Subsection (3), the charging section says that tax shall be levied on every motor vehicle issued or kept for use in the state of Tamil Nadu at the rate specified in the Schedule. Subsection (4) provides for payment of tax in the manner prescribed at ‘his choice either quarterly, half-yearly or annually. Section 4(2) says that no motor vehicle shall be used or kept for use in the state of Tamil Nadu at any time unless a licence has been obtained by paying the tax. Section 14 provides for penalty for ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 26 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 non-payment of tax. Section 18- A provides for detention of the motor vehicle for nonpayment of tax. Section 20 of the said Act provides for remissions of tax subject to certain conditions. In exercise of this power, the Government, in G.O. Ms. No. 1122, Home (Transport, A) Department dated 10.7.1992, reduced the rate of tax with effect from 7.11.1990 in respect of tourist vehicles at the rates specified. The order says that if the period of use does not exceed seven days, the temporary permits granted in respect of tourist vehicles need only pay one-tenth, one-third of the quarterly tax specified in the First Schedule and equivalent to the quarterly tax, if it exceeds 90 days. Hence, assuming in favour of the petitioners, it applies only to temporary permits issued for less than 30 days.
22. In view of the above discussion, this Court has absolutely no hesitation to hold that the Petitioners are liable to pay the tax under the Act in order to ply the tourist vehicle in the State of Tamil Nadu. The first issue is answered accordingly.
23. The second issue is with regard to the breach of permit conditions. According to the Respondents, the Petitioners, who have a tourist vehicle can only use it as a contract carriage, and instead, the same is being used a stage carriage. For this purpose,Sec 2 (7) and (40) of the Motor Vehicle Act was brought to the notice of this Court. That apart, the judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Roshan Lal Gautam v. State of Uttar pradesh reported in AIR 1965 SC 991 and Brijendra Kumar Chaudhari v. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in 1992 4 SCC 703 were pressed into service. Reliance was also placed upon the list of passengers and the destination from where they were picked up and where they are dropped. The Respondents came to the conclusion on the prima facie material that there was a breach of permit conditions and accordingly, the vehicles were detained in exercise of powers under Section 207 of the Motor Vehicle Act.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 27 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
24. This Court does not want go into the factual dispute as to whether the Petitioners have violated the permit conditions. The same has to be decided by the competent authority based on the explanation given by the Petitioners. This Court does not want to go into the issue and give a finding at this preliminary stage. Therefore, it is left open to the Petitioners to give their explanation before the Respondents 4 and 5 and based on the same, a decision can be taken in accordance with law. The second issue is answered accordingly.
25. The upshot of the above discussion leads to the conclusion that there is no illegality or arbitrariness in the action taken by the Respondents. The Petitioners are liable to pay the tax under the Act and Rules thereunder, if they want to ply the vehicle in the State of Tamil Nadu. In so far as the breach of permit condition is concerned, the Petitioners shall give their explanation along with all the materials before the 4 th and 5th Respondents and the same shall be considered and appropriate orders shall be passed within a period of 1 week from the date of receipt of the explanation from the Petitioners. If the vehicles have been detained, the same shall be released after a final decision is taken by the concerned authority and the Petitioners make the necessary payments, if levied.”
37. I am however unable to subscribe to the above view as the constitutionality and vires of All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 was not challenged before the court in the said case.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 28 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 That apart Section 89(9) of the Motor vehicle Act 1988 specifically gives powers to the Central Government to frame rules Guidelines for Recogni-
tion/Renewal or Extension as an approved tourist Transport Operator (TTO).
38. Without declaring Section 88(9) ultra vires, it is not open to dilute the Rules made there under. Further there is presumption of constitutionality of provision of the Act and rules made thereunder. There also cannot be double taxation if the vehicle was indeed used as a “tourist vehicle” i.e. as a “Contract Carriage” under the provision of the All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 read with Section 88(9) &(14) and Section 89 of the Motor Vehicle Act 1988.
39. The use of the subject bus by the petitioner prima facie indicates that the petitioner had used it as a “ stage carriage” though the petitioner has obtained “Permit”, “Authorisation” under All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021. If the use of a “Stage Carriage” was disguised as a “Tourist Vehicle” albeit as a “Contract Carriage the benefit of “Authorization” and “Permit” issued under All ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 29 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022 India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021, will not insure to the petitioner.
40. The petitioner has now been issued with a demand notice dated 08.06.2022 pursuant to the order dated 18.10.2021 of this Court in W.P.No.19949 of 2021. In the above demand notices dated 8.6.2022, the petitioner has been called upon to show cause as to why a sum of Rs.36,000/- after from Rs.10,000/- towards tax and an equal amount of Rs. 36,000/- towards penalty apart from Rs.10,000/- for plying the subject bus without a pollution certificate as per Section 190(2) the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019 and +Rs.500/- for not producing records at the time of inspection as per Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019] to consider the release of subject Bus bearing Registration No.NL01B1080 registered as a All India Tourist Omni Bus should not be demanded from the petitioner under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 read with rule Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Rules, 1974.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 30 of 34 W.P.No.12649 of 2022
41. If the subject Bus impounded was used as a “Stage Carriage”, the benefit of “Permit” and “Authorization” issued under All India Tourist Vehicles (Authorisation or Permit) Rules, 2021 will not come to the rescue of the petitioner as under Section 66 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 only a stage carriage can be used as a “Contract Carriage” subject to certain conditions as may be specified and not vice versa is not specified.
42. The petitioner is therefore directed to give its reply to the above notice within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
43. The fifth respondent is directed to adjudicate and dispose after the Demand Notice dated 08.06.2022 issued to the petitioner in the light of the above observation within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of this order.
