Delhi High Court
National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Komal & Ors. on 27 April, 2012
Author: J.R. Midha
1. The appellant has challenged the award of the Claims Tribunal whereby compensation of `5,84,000/- has been awarded to claimants/respondents No.1 to 4. The appellant seeks reduction of the award amount.
2. The accident dated 4th July, 2005 resulted in the death of Amit Dhingra. The deceased was survived by his widow, two minor children and father who filed the claim petition before the Claims Tribunal. The deceased was aged 23 years at the time of the accident and was running a tent house business. In the absence of documentary proof of income, the Claims Tribunal assumed the income of the deceased to be `5,000/- per month, deducted 1/3rd towards his personal expenses and applied the multiplier of 17 to compute the loss of dependency at `6,80,000/-. The Claims Tribunal deducted 20% towards the contributory negligence. The Claims Tribunal further awarded `10,000/- towards the funeral expenses, `10,000/- towards transportation of dead body, `10,000/- towards loss of estate and `10,000/- towards loss of consortium. The total compensation awarded is `5,84,000/-.
3. The learned counsel for the appellant has urged following grounds at the time of hearing of this appeal:-
(i) There is no basis for assuming the income of the deceased to be `5,000/- per month and the Claims Tribunal should have taken the minimum wages of `3,468/- per month into consideration. The increase in minimum wages cannot be taken into consideration.
(ii) The multiplier be reduced from 17 to 13.
4. In Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy v. UOI 104 (2003) DLT 234 (DB), the Division Bench of this Court applied the multiplier method and the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to compute the compensation payable to the victims of the Uphaar Tragedy. The Division Bench held that the victims of the fire incident belonged to reasonably well-placed families and presumed that the average income of the victims above age of 20 years to be not less than `15,000/- per month, 1/3rd was deducted towards the personal expenses and the multiplier of 15 was applied to compute the compensation as `18,00,000/-. With respect to the children, the Division Bench awarded compensation of `15,00,000/-. The Division Bench also awarded interest @ 9% per annum. The findings of the Division Bench of this Court are reproduced hereunder :-
For victims aged more than 20 years:-
(`8,333/- less 1/3rd )x 12 x 15 = `10 lakhs.
For victims aged less than 20 years:-
(`6249/- less 1/3rd ) x 15 = `7.5 lakhs.
7. It is relevant to note that the Uphaar Tragedy took place on 13th June, 1997 and the minimum wages at the relevant time ranged from `1677/- for unskilled workers to `2437/- for graduates. It is thus clear that although there was no proof of the income of the victims, the Supreme Court did not find it proper to apply the minimum wages.
8. The deceased was engaged in the tent house business and, therefore, the income assumed of `5,000/- by the Claims Tribunal does not warrant any interference in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra). The minimum wages cannot be taken into consideration in respect of self-employed persons.
9. The Claims Tribunal has applied the multiplier of 17 and deducted 1/3rd towards the personal expenses of the deceased. However, the appropriate multiplier at the age of 23 is 18 and appropriate deduction towards personal expenses of the deceased is 1/4th in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation, (2009) 6 SCC 121. Following the aforesaid judgment, the multiplier is enhanced from 17 to 18 and the personal expenses are reduced from 1/3rd to 1/4th.
10. Taking the income of the deceased as `5,000/- per month, deducting 1/4th towards the personal expenses of the deceased and applying the multiplier of 18, the loss of dependency is computed to be `8,10,000/- (`5,000 x 12 x 3/4 x 18). The legal heirs of the deceased are entitled to total compensation of `6,88,000/- as per the break-up given hereinbelow:-
Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been discussed time and again by the Supreme Court in the following cases:-

(i) Pannalal v. State of Bombay, AIR 1963 SC 1516.
(ii) Rameshwar Prasad v. M/s Shyam Beharilal Jagannath, (1964) 3 SCR 549.
(iii) Nirmal Bala Ghose v. Balai Chand Ghose, AIR 1965 SC 1874.
(iv) Giasi Ram v. Ramjilal, AIR 1969 SC 1144.
12. Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 empowers the Court to award such compensation as appears to be just which has been interpreted to mean just in accordance with law and it can be more than the amount claimed by the claimants. The provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 are clearly a beneficial legislation and hence should be interpreted in a way to enable the Court to assess just compensation. The scope of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the power of the High Court to enhance the award amount in accident cases in the absence of cross- objections has been discussed by the Supreme Court in Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh, AIR 2003 SC 674 where the Apex Court has held that the Court is required to determine just compensation and there is no other limitation or restriction for awarding such compensation and in appropriate cases wherefrom the evidence brought on record if the Tribunal/Court considers that the claimant is entitled to get more compensation than claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award and would empower the Court to enhance the compensation at the appellate stage even without the injured filing an appeal or cross-objections.

13. The scope of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure in motor accident cases has been exhaustively discussed in the following three High Court judgments:-
(i) In National Insurance Company v. Rani, 2006 ACJ 1224, the Division Bench of Madras High Court held as under:-
(ii) In Oriental Fire And General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Amarsing Pratapsing Sikliker, I (1993) ACC 627, the Division Bench of Gujarat High held as under:-
(iii) In Prakramchand v. Chuttan, AIR 1991 MP 280, the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court held as under:-
14. For the reasons as aforesaid, the appeal is dismissed and the award amount is enhanced from `5,84,000/- to `6,88,000/- along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till realization. The shares of the claimants in the enhanced award amount shall be equal.
15. The appellant has deposited the amount awarded by the Claims Tribunal out of which `5,00,000/- has been released to the claimants and the remaining amount is lying with the Claims Tribunal. Let the remaining amount be released to the claimants in terms of the award of the Claims Tribunal.
