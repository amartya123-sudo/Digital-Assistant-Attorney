Sanspal Singh vs . State Of Delhi, 1999, Cr.L.J 1A. ... on 15 February, 2014
Author: Ms. Balwinder Singh
1. Vide this judgment, I shall dispose of the present challan filed by the prosecution under Section 66/192A, 39/192, 184 & DMVR 7/177 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as M.V. Act). The brief fact of the case as per prosecution are that on 06.09.2012 at about 06.25 p.m. accused Mohd. Idrish was driving one Gramin Sewa vehicle bearing No. DL­2W­5108 at Saket Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 1 of 20 Metro Station while plying his vehicle towards Khanpur. It is the case of prosecution that the accused was carrying 13 passengers inside the offending vehicle and was driving the same waivingly in a very dangerous manner. As per the prosecution, the Contract Carriage Permit issued in favour of permit holder does not cover the place of offence i.e. Saket Metro Station. It was further alleged against him that he was also without uniform at that time. Therefore, the challaning officer issued the present challan against him which is Ex.PW­1/A for violation of permit conditions, violation of conditions of registration certificate, for driving without uniform, for not having a valid driving licence and also for dangerous driving. The challaning officer also issued challan against the owner of vehicle which is Ex.PW­1/B as the accused driver was found without valid driving licence.

2. It is pertinent to mention here that after appearing before the court, the accused driver pleaded guilty for the offence U/s 3/181 of M.V. Act to which he was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.500/­. Similarly, owner of vehicle also pleaded guilty for the challan U/s 5/180 of M.V.Act issued against him and he was also sentenced to Rs.500/­. For the remaining offences, the accused driver pleaded not guilty. Since the offences were bailable, the accused driver was admitted to bail on furnishing of bail bond and surety bond in a sum of Rs.10,000/­. An application for the release of offending vehicle on superdari was moved by the owner of the vehicle and the same was accepted and the vehicle was released on superdari on furnishing of superdarinama in a sum of Rs.3,00,000/­.
3. Notice of accusation was served upon the accused/driver U/s 251 CrPC to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 2 of 20
4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined two witnesses namely PW1 SI V.S. Deol, No.1858D, MRC and PW2 Const. Narender, No.3615T, Mehrauli and also proved the challan which is Ex.PW­1/A.
PW1 SI V.S. Deol in his examination­in­chief deposed that on the day of incident i.e. 06.09.2012 he was posted on duty at Saket Metro Station alongwith PW2 Const. Narender Kumar. At around 06.25 p.m., the offending vehicle came from Saket Metro Station towards Khanpur side after taking U­turn from Saket Metro Red light. The accused driver was driving the same in a very dangerous and waiving manner and he was without uniform. PW1 directed the accused driver to stop his vehicle for the purpose of checking. PW2 found that the accused driver was carrying 13 passengers inside his vehicle. Thereafter, when PW1 asked the accused driver to produce the documents of the vehicle, he could not produce his valid driving licence and a valid contract carriage permit issued by the concerned transport authority, therefore, PW1 issued the present challan which is Ex.PW­1/A bearing his signatures at point A. PW1 also issued a challan which is Ex.PW­1/B bearing his signature at point B against the owner of vehicle and vehicle was also impounded U/s 207 of M.V. Act and was deposited at Lado Sarai pit.
In his cross examination, PW1 deposed that some of the passengers inside the vehicle was sitting on the back seats of the vehicle and some of them were sitting on the back seat adjoining the seat of the driver. The passengers included male, female and some children also. PW1 further deposed that he stopped the offending vehicle near Saket Metro Station, Gate No.1. PW1 also deposed that for the Gramin Sewa vehicles having route No.GS­154 (as in the present case for the offending vehicle ) a U­turn is provided at few metres (500­600) metres before Saket Metro Station and these vehicles should take U­ Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 3 of 20 turn from that Red Light and they cannot come to Saket Metro Station for the purpose of picking passengers as route No.GS­154 does not cover the area of Saket Metro Station. In the end, PW1 negated the suggestion of the Ld. Defence Counsel that the offending vehicle was on its route and was without any passengers.
In his examination­in­chief, PW2 Const. Narender Kumar deposed that on the day of incident i.e. 06.09.2012, he was posted on duty at Saket Metro Station alongwith PW1 SI V.S. Deol. At about 06.25 p.m. The offending vehicle came from Saket Metro side and it was going towards Khanpur side. The accused driver was driving the same waivingly in a very dangerous manner. PW2 directed the accused driver to stop his vehicle. There were 13 passengers sitting inside the vehicle. PW2 asked the accused driver to produce the documents of the vehicle and handed over the same to PW1 who was also present there alongwith him. As per PW2, the accused driver could not produced his valid driving licence and permit of the vehicle. Thereafter, PW1 issued the present challan which is Ex.PW­1/A bearing his signature at point X and also issued a challan against owner of vehicle which is Ex.PW­1/B. The offending vehicle was also impounded U/s 207 of M.V. Act and was deposited at Lado Sarai pit.
In his cross examination, PW2 deposed that there were 13 passengers were sitting inside the vehicle and 07 of them were female passengers. The accused driver was also without uniform.

5. The statement of accused/driver U/s 313 CrPC was recorded. During the examination of accused U/s 313 CrPC, the entire incriminating evidence appearing against the accused was put to him and he was given an opportunity to explain the incriminating evidence appearing against him to which he submitted that all the Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 4 of 20 allegations levelled against him are incorrect that he has been falsely challaned in the present case.

6. After examination of the accused/driver U/s 313 CrPC, he submitted that he do not wish to lead Defence Evidence and therefore, the matter was fixed for hearing of final arguments.

7. I have heard Ld. APP for the State as well as Ld. Defence Counsel at length and have carefully gone through the entire record and evidence and after carefully perusing the same, I am giving my finding as per below:
In the present challan, the accused was challaned for the violations of Section 66/192A, 39/192, 184 & DMVR 7/177 of M.V. Act,1988.

(3) The court to which an appeal lies from any conviction in respect of an offence of the nature specified in sub­ section(1), may set aside or vary any order made by the court below, notwithstanding that no appeal lies against the conviction in connection with which such order was made. There are two other corresponding provision also pertaining to sec. 39 of the motor vehicle Act, 1988. These are :
(1) Section 58 (2) of the M.V. Act provides that:­ (2) A registering authority, when registering a transport vehicle, other than a motor cab, shall enter in the record of registration and shall also enter in the certificate of registration of the vehicle the following particulars, namely:­
(a) the unladen weight of the vehicle;
(b) the number, nature and size of the tyres attached to each wheel;
(c) the gross vehicle weight of the vehicle and the registered axle weights pertaining to the several axles thereof; and
(d) if the vehicle is used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers solely or in addition to goods, the number of passengers for whom accommodation is provided, (2) DMVR rule 67 (1) provides that:

With the combined reading of these sections mentioned above it becomes clear that it is mandatory for the owner of a transport vehicle who has got a Registration Certificate for the vehicle to abide by the conditions mentioned in the Registration Certificate and if he violates those condition then it will amount to violations of Registration Certificate which is an offence U/s 39 and made punishable U/s 192 of M.V. Act.
Section 184 of The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 provides that: Driving dangerously - Whoever drives a motor vehicle at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the nature, condition and use of the place where the vehicle is driven and the amount of traffic which actually is at the time or which might reasonable be expected to be in the place, shall be punishable for the first offence with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, and for any second or subsequent offence if committed within three years of the commission of a previous similar offence with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to two thousand rupees, or with both.
Rule 7 of DMVR provides that :
Driver's Uniform.­The driver of a public service vehicle Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 12 of 20 other than driver of State Transport Undertaking, while on duty, shall wear khaki uniform with a name plate in Hindi affixed on it. The driver of a State Transport Undertaking shall wear uniform as prescribed by that State Transport Undertaking.
The penalty for the violation of rule 7 of DMVR is provided under sec. 177 of the Motor vehicle Act. Section 177 of M.V. Act provides that:
General provision for punishment of offences - Whoever contravenes any provision of this Act or of any rule, regulation or notification made thereunder shall, if no penalty is provided for the offence be punishable for the first offence with fine which may extend to one hundred rupees, and for any second or subsequent offence with fine which may extend to three hundred rupees.
It is also important to go through some other important provisions for the better understanding of violation of provisions of Motor Vehicle Act as alleged to be committed by the accused. Therefore, we must understand the meaning of permit, contract carriage permit as well as stage carriage permit, a motor vehicle, a transport vehicle and fares.

8. Thus in order to prove the guilt of the accused and to sustain his conviction the prosecution is required to establish beyond reasonable doubts that:

To prove this, firstly Ld. APP for State has argued before the court that both the prosecution witness namely PW1 SI V.S. Deol and PW2 Const.
Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 15 of 20 Narender has proved the challan on record and have correctly identified the accused. Both the prosecution witnesses have remained consistent in their testimonies throughout the trial. Both the prosecution witnesses have categorically deposed about the fact that the accused was driving the offending vehicle at Saket Metro Station i.e. a place not covered by the route permit issued in favour of permit holder. Both of them are consistent with respect to the fact that the offending vehicle was carrying 13 passengers inside it and also with respect to the fact that the accused driver was without uniform and was driving the same waivingly in a dangerous manner. The testimony of both the prosecution witnesses gets corroboration from each other and the absence of any public witnesses does not itself throw away the story of prosecution particularly when there is no allegation of ill motive or falsehood against any of the prosecution witnesses.
On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for accuse has pointed out that there are many inconsistencies and loop holes in the testimonies of both the prosecution witnesses which makes their story unreliable.
Firstly, the Ld. Counsel has pointed out that as per the prosecution story, the place of offence does not fall within the area alloted as per the route permit issued to the permit holder. As per their allegation, the route No.GS­154 allotted to the permit holder does not extends upto Saket Metro Station. However, nothing on record has been produced by the prosecution to prove that allegation. Neither any documentary proof was placed nor any report from the transport authority regarding the position of place of offence i.e. whether it falls within the route No.GS­154 or not, was produced before the court to substantiate that allegation.
Secondly, the Ld. Defence Counsel has argued before the court that the accused has categorically deposed in his statement U/s 313 CrPC that he was Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 16 of 20 not plying the vehicle at Saket Metro Station on the day of incident. Ld. Counsel has further argued that the testimony of both the prosecution witnesses remains uncorroborated to that effect as no public witness has been joined in the present case to provide corroboration to their testimonies. Even none of the passenger who was present inside the vehicle as alleged by both the prosecution witnesses was made a witness in the present case. Both the challaning officer have also failed to provide any reasonable explanation for such omission.
Thirdly, with respect to the allegation that the accused driver was carrying 13 passengers, the testimony of both the prosecution witnesses again remains uncorroborated as there has been no public witness joined in the present case. Even the name and address of the passengers who were present inside the vehicle were also not noted by any of the prosecution witnesses.
Fourthly, the Ld. Defence Counsel has argued that the allegation against the accused driver that he was driving the offending vehicle dangerously is also without substance as nothing material has been deposed by any of the prosecution witnesses in that regard. Both the prosecution witnesses have simply deposed that the accused driver was driving the offending vehicle waivingly in a dangerous manner. However, the ingredients to prove offence of dangerous driving are missing. Neither the traffic condition of the road (condition/use of the place where the vehicle was driven, the amount of traffic on the road etc.) at the time of violation was given nor it was mentioned that how the plying of vehicle by the accused was dangerous to the public. Simply deposing that the accused was plying the vehicle waivingly does not itself makes it dangerous driving.
Lastly, the Ld. Defence Counsel has argued that since the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt any of the allegation levelled against the accused, therefore, he should be acquitted of all the charges Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 17 of 20 levelled against him.
On the other hand, the Ld. APP for the State has countered the arguments of the Ld. Defence Counsel. Ld. APP for the State has argued before the court that as per the Contract Carriage Permit itself which is issued to the permit holder it becomes clear that the accused was violating the route permit conditions. As per the route permit GS­154 the route allotted extends from Deoli village to Maidan Garhi and it covers the area of Deoli village, Khanpur, M.B. Road, Neb Sarai road and Maidan Garhi (IGNOU). On the bare perusal of route permit itself it becomes clear that the place of offence does not falls within it. Accordingly, there is no further need of any documentary proof or any report from the State Transport Authority.
Secondly, the Ld. APP for the State has argued before the court that the argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel that since no public witness has been joined in the present case, therefore, the testimony of prosecution witnesses cannot be relied upon is also without any substance. Ld. APP has submitted that it is not a rule of law that in every case where public witnesses are not joined the case of the prosecution must be thrown away. It just puts the court at guard and it becomes a duty of the court in such a case to appreciate the available evidence carefully and in totality with the other circumstantial evidence available and see whether the testimony of such witness is consistent with the circumstantial evidence or not. And if the circumstantial evidences reading conjunctively with the available testimony leans towards the hypothesis that the accused would have committed the offence then in such a case there would be no reason to disbelieve the testimony of such prosecution witnesses.
Further, the Ld. Defence Counsel has argued that the argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel that the prosecution has failed to prove the allegation of Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 18 of 20 dangerous driving against the accused since the details of the traffic condition on the road at the time of violation and other details were missing, is also without any substance. Both the prosecution witnesses have clearly deposed that the accused was carrying 13 passengers inside the vehicle and was driving the same waivingly in a very dangerous fashion. Carrying excess passengers than the permissible limit of a vehicle itself makes it dangerous to drive the vehicle on road and further driving it waivingly in a zig­zag manner further increases the possibility of accidents on the road and in such a case the passengers may fell from the vehicle. Therefore, the allegation of dangerous driving also stands proved against the accused driver. Similarly, the allegation of violation of condition of registration certificate also stands proved as both the prosecution witnesses categorically deposed that the offending vehicle was carrying 13 passengers inside it which is beyond its permissible limit of six passengers.
Further, the allegation that the accused driver was without uniform also stands proved as both the prosecution witnesses have clearly deposed that the accused driver was found without uniform at the time of violation.
In the end, Ld. APP for the State has submitted that since the prosecution has proved all the allegations against the accused, therefore, he must be convicted for the same.

9. After all the discussion above, the court finds merits in the submission of Ld. APP for the State. All the allegations levelled against the accused stands proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The route permit allotted in favour of permit holder itself makes it clear that it does not covers the area of place of offence. The allegation of violation of registration certificate, dangerous driving and without uniform also stands proved in view of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses Vehicle No. : DL­2W­5108 19 of 20 as the same has remained intact and consistent throughout the trial. The court finds merit in the argument of Ld. APP for the State that there is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of prosecution witnesses particularly when there is no allegation of ill­motive or falsehood against any of the prosecution witnesses. The same view has also been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sanspal Singh Vs. State of Delhi, 1999, Cr.L.J 1a. Accordingly, the accused stands convicted for all the charges levelled against him as prosecution has proved the same beyond all reasonable doubts.
Let the accused driver be heard separately on quantum of sentence. The fact of this conviction be also brought to the notice of concerned traffic circle through the Naib Court of this Court so that the appropriate action may be taken against the accused for the violation of conditions of permit issued in favour of the permit holder.
