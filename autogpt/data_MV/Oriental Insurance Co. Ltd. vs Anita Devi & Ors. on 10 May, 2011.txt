1. This appeal preferred by M/s. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. seeks to assail the judgment and award dated 13.01.2010 on the short ground that the amount of compensation allowed by the Claims Tribunal on account of the death of Shri Mohan Mishra (hereinafter referred to as "the deceased") was not in accordance with Section 163-A read with the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act and the structured formula delineated therein.
2. With the consent of the parties, the appeal is taken up for final hearing at this stage.
3. Although initially the respondents No.1 to 5 had filed a claim petition under Section 166 read with Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, subsequently the petition was converted into one under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 with the permission of the Claims Tribunal.
4. The Claims Tribunal after holding that the factum of death of the deceased stood established and also the involvement of truck No.DL-1LB-1726 and thus the ingredients required for a claim under Section 163-A of the Act stood fulfilled, proceeded to quantify the compensation due and payable to the respondents No.1 to 5/claimants. For the aforesaid purpose, the Claims Tribunal held that recourse to the minimum wages for unskilled workers was required in view of the fact that there was no documentary evidence on record for establishing the income of the deceased who was stated to be Kachori vendor earning a sum of ` 3,300/- per month. Since the minimum wage rate for an unskilled worker on the date of the accident, that is, 24.05.2005, was in the sum of ` 3,165/- per month, the Claims Tribunal assessed the aforesaid sum to be the income of the deceased. Thereafter, applying the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121, it held that the monthly income of the deceased would have increased by 50% by the end of his working career, that is, by ` 1,582.50, and thus his average monthly income would have totalled a sum of ` 4,747.50. Deducting 1/4th therefrom for the personal expenses of the deceased in view of the fact that the deceased had five dependents, the Claims Tribunal assessed the remaining amount of ` 3, 560.62 to be the loss of dependency of the claimants per month, that is, ` 42,727.44 per annum. The aforesaid multiplicand was multiplied by 16 and the total loss of dependency was assessed to be in the sum of ` 6,83,639.04, that is, ` 42,727.44 x 16. In addition, the claimants were held entitled to a sum of ` 10,000/- under the head of loss of estate, ` 10,000/- towards funeral expenses, ` 10,000/- towards loss of consortium and ` 1,00,000/- for loss of love and affection of the deceased. In all, ` 7,64,000/- (i.e. ` 813639.04 - 50,000/- interim award) with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of deposit of the award amount.
5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid findings of the Tribunal, the appellant has preferred the present appeal in which the only ground sought to be urged by Mr. L.K. Tyagi, the learned counsel for the appellant was that the findings of the Claims Tribunal, having been rendered in a petition under Section 163-A of the Act, the Claims Tribunal was required to adhere to the structured formula laid down in the said Section read with the Second Schedule to the Act. In this context, Mr. Tyagi made a three-fold submissions before this Court as follows:
6. Mr. Sushil Kumar, the learned counsel for the respondents No.1 to 5 sought to support the award by rebutting all the aforesaid contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant. In the alternative, he submitted that the multiplier adopted by the Claims Tribunal was not in accordance with the Second Schedule which required a multiplier of 17 to be applied to the age group of victims between 31 and 35 years of age. Since the deceased in the instant case was admittedly 34 years at the time of the accident, the Claims Tribunal should have applied the multiplier of 17 instead of the multiplier of 16 to augment the multiplicand constituting the loss of dependency of the respondents No.1 to 5.
7. In a recent decision of this Court rendered in MAC. APP. No.190/2011 titled as "Jagdish and Anr. vs. Madhav Raj Mishra and Anr." decided on April 19, 2011, this Court had considered the question as to whether in a claim petition instituted under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, while assessing compensation to a third party involved in a fatal accident, the structured formula referred to in the Second Schedule was required to be strictly adhered to and had held that the Second Schedule and the structured formula laid down therein was required to be strictly adhered to while assessing compensation under the aforesaid Section. The relevant portion of the said judgment reads as follows:
8. In view of the aforesaid, it must be held that the Claims Tribunal, in the instant case gravely erred in not adhering to the structured formula laid down in the Second Schedule and in calculating the compensation in the present petition treating it to be a petition under Section 166 of the Act. This being so, the amount of compensation awardable to the respondents No.1 to 5 is required to be re-computed in accordance with the Second Schedule. The income of the deceased was assessed to be in the sum of ` 3,165/- per month in accordance with the minimum wage rate applicable to an unskilled workman on the date of the accident. Deducting 1/3 rd therefrom, the loss of dependency of the respondents No.1 to 5 comes to ` 2,110/- per month, that is, ` 25,320/- per annum. The age of the deceased at the time of the accident being 34 years, the appropriate multiplier would be the multiplier of 17. Thus calculated, the total loss of dependency of the respondents No.1 to 5 works out to ` 4,30,440/-, that is, ` 25,320/- x 17. As per the Second Schedule, the non- pecuniary damages awardable to the legal representatives of the deceased are in the sum of ` 2,000/- for funeral expenses, ` 5,000/- towards loss of consortium where the beneficiary is the spouse and ` 2,500/- towards the loss of estate. Adding the aforesaid general damages, the total amount of compensation payable to the respondents No.1 to 5 works out to ` 4,39,940/-, which may be rounded off to ` 4,40,000/-. The respondents No.1 to 5 shall also be entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of the institution of the claim petition, i.e., from 19.01.2006 till the date of realisation.
9. The award stands modified accordingly. In view of the fact that the awarded amount along with the interest thereon till April 09, 2010 is lying deposited with the UCO Bank, Delhi High Court branch, through nodal officer in the account of the claimants, the claimants shall be at liberty to withdraw the sum of ` 4,40,000/- with interest thereon. The balance amount shall be refunded to the appellant - Insurance Company.
The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent and stands disposed of.
