Bangalore District Court
Sri. M. Manikandan vs Smt. Lakshmamma on 4 July, 2015
Petitioner has filed this petition under Section 166 of M.V.Act against the respondents claiming compensation for the injuries sustained in RTA.

2) The brief facts of the case of the petitioner are as under: On 25.01.2014 at about 11.45 p.m., when the petitioner was standing in front of Kamath Uphar hotel, near IOC petrol bunk, Narasapur on a footpath on NH-04 road to cross the road, at that time, the driver of Tata Sumo Vehicle bearing Regn. No.KA-05-AA-4848 driven the said vehicle from Bangalore to Kolar side in rash and negligent manner endangering human life with high speed and dashed to the motor cycle of the petitioner by which the petitioner sustained grievous injuries. Immediately after the accident, the petitioner was taken to R.L. Jalappa hospital and after first aid, he was referred to K.R. Puram Super Speciality hospital and after two days, he was referred to Manipal hospital and admitted as an inpatient from 27.01.2014 to 11.02.2014. The accidental injuries have caused permanent disability and petitioner has lost his earnings. The petitioner was working as cleaner and earning Rs.10,000/- per month and due to the accidental injuries, he has lost his income. The Scch - 11 3 MVC No.1536/2014 jurisdictional police have registered the case against the driver of the offending vehicle. The respondents being owner and insurer of offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner has filed this petition for claiming the compensation.

3) Though notice is served upon the respondent No.1, he has not appeared and contested the claim petition. Hence, he has been placed exparte.

4) Respondent No.2 has filed written statement and denied the age, occupation, income, time, date and place of accident, involvement of the vehicle and valid and effective driving licence by the driver of offending vehicle. The respondent No.1 has failed to comply the mandatory provision of under Section 134(c) of Motor Vehicles Act and Jurisdictional police have failed to comply section 158(6) of Motor Vehicle Act. The driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence and respondent No.1 entrusted the said vehicle to the driver of the offending vehicle and thereby violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy. The compensation claimed by the petitioner is arbitrary and excessive. The accident taken place due to negligence of the Scch - 11 4 MVC No.1536/2014 petitioner and there is no negligence on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle. The respondent No.2 admitted the issuance of insurance policy in respect of the offending vehicle, but liability of the respondent No.2 is subject to the terms and condition of insurance policy and provision of Motor Vehicles Act and Rules. If the respondent No.1 fails to appear before this Court and contest the claim petition, the respondent No.2 may be permitted to avail all defences available to insured under Section 170 of Motor Vehicles Act. Therefore, it is prayed for dismissal of the claim petition.

5) The petitioner himself examined as PW.1 and also examined Dr. Nagaraj B.N S/o Late. B.K.N. Swamy as PW.2 and got marked Ex.P.1 to 25 and closed the evidence.

6) Heard the arguments of the learned counsels for both parties and perused the evidence on record.

7) On the basis of pleadings, following issues have been framed:
1. Whether the petitioner proves that on 25.01.2014 at about 11.45 p.m., in front of Kamath Upahar Hotel, Scch - 11 5 MVC No.1536/2014 near IVO Petrol Bunk, Narasapura on footpath of NH-4 road, when petitioner was standing there to cross the road with loaded diesel Can, at that time, the driver of TATA Sumo bearing No.KA-05-AA-
4848 driven the said vehicle in the rash and negligent manner and with high speed and dashed to the petitioner by which sustained grievous injuries?
2. Whether respondent No.2 proves that the driver of the offending vehicle was not having valid and effective driving licence as on the date of accident?
3. Whether petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties?
4. Whether petition is entitled to for compensation? If so, what amount and from whom?
5. What Order or award?

8) My findings on the above issues are as under:
25.01.2014 at about 11.45 p.m., he was standing on the footpath of the road in front of Kamath Upahar hotel, near IOC petrol bunk, Narasapur on NH-04 road to cross the road, at that time, the driver of Tata Sumo Vehicle bearing Regn. No.KA-05-AA-4848 driven the said vehicle from Bangalore to Kolar and dashed to him. He has stated that, he sustained injuries due to the rash and negligent driving by the driver of offending vehicle. The learned counsel for petitioner has contended in his argument that, the petitioner was standing in front of Kamath Upahar hotel, near IOC Petrol bunk, Narasapur on a footpath on N.H-04 road to cross the road along with loaded diesel can, at that time, the driver of Tata Sumo vehicle driven the same in rash and negligent manner and dashed to the petitioner. He has also submitted that, the accident taken place due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of the offending vehicle. The learned counsel for respondent insurance company has submitted in his arguments that, petitioner has stated in his evidence that, he was standing besides the road and nobody told him about the vehicle number which caused the accident. PW.2 has stated that, the driver of the Lorry was sitting in the cabin of the lorry on the end of the another side and the accident taken place at another end of road and there is road divider and Scch - 11 7 MVC No.1536/2014 there are no chances to driver of the lorry to witness the accident and the insured vehicle has been falsely implicated in order to claim the compensation. In the cross-examination of PW.1, he has stated that, on that day, there was no traffic on the said road. Nobody told the vehicle number which caused the accident. He has also stated that, the Lorry driver told him about vehicle which caused the accident. He has also stated that, there is road divider in between two roads on the national highway and his Lorry was proceeding from Kolar to Bangalore and it was stopped at the place of accident. He has also stated in his evidence that, he was standing on the road in the direction from Bangalore to Kolar, when he was bringing diesel from the Petrol bunk and the driver of the lorry was in the Lorry.

10) The petitioner has produced Ex.P.1 and P.2, which are the true copy of FIR and complaint and as per the said documents, the accident taken place on 25.01.2014 at about 11.45 p.m., in front of Kamath Upahar hotel, near IOC Petrol bunk, Narasapur on the footpath on N.H.04 road by the driver of the offending vehicle. The FIR is registered on 26.01.2014 at about 1.30 p.m. by the Vemagal police in crime No.26/2014. The petitioner has also produced Ex.P.4, which is mahazar drawn by the police at the place of accident at about 3.00 to 3.45 p.m. On perusal of the Scch - 11 8 MVC No.1536/2014 contents of the mahazar, it discloses that at the time of mahazar, the said vehicle was on the spot and it was seized by the police in the presence of panch witnesses. This goes to show that, after causing the accident, the driver of the offending vehicle left his vehicle and went away and there are chances for the driver of the Lorry to see the vehicle number and file the complaint to the police. In case, the said vehicle dashed to the petitioner and went away from the place of accident, then the contention of the learned counsel for respondent No.2 would have been acceptable. But after the accident, the offending vehicle was left out at the place of accident only and the lorry driver would have came to the spot and identified the vehicle and given the complaint. As per the Motor Vehicle Inspection report, the front side portion of the vehicle damaged in the said accident. The police have filed charge sheet against the driver of the offending vehicle for the offences punishable under Section 279, 337 and 338 of IPC.

11) On perusal of the charge sheet and enclosures, they reveal that, the accident taken place due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of the offending vehicle. The evidence of the PW.1 cannot be disbelieved only for the reason that, he has not seen the vehicle, which caused the said accident. So, the contention taken by the learned counsel Scch - 11 9 MVC No.1536/2014 for respondent No.2 is not acceptable. So, I answer issue No.1 in the affirmative.

12) Issue No.2 : Respondent No.2 taken contention that, as on the date of accident, the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence. But this contention of the respondent No.2 is not acceptable. Because, the respondent No.2 has not adduced the evidence of licensing authority to prove the contention that there was no valid driving licence to the driver of the offending vehicle. Even in the decision reported in Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in National Insurance Co. Ltd. V/s Swaran Singh and others in 2004 ACJ page No.1 in which it is held as under:

Motor insurance-Driving licence-Defences available to insurance company-Driver possessing licence for one type of vehicle but found driving another type of vehicle whether Scch - 11 10 MVC No.1536/2014 liability of insurance company would depend upon the fact that driver not possessing requisite type of licence was the main or contributory cause of accident or not-Held; yes; insurer will not be allowed to avoid its liability merely on technical breach of conditions concerning driving licence.
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, section 149 (2) (a) (ii)- Motor insurance-Policy-Breach of-Driving licence-Insurance company established breach on the part of insured concerning policy condition regarding holding of a valid and effective driving licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant period but the breach was not so fundamental as found to have contributed to the cause of accident-Whether the insurance company exempted from liability-Held; no; Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would apply 'the rule of main purpose' and the concept of 'fundamental breach to allow defences available to the insurer under section 149 (2) of the Act. In one more decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Sri. S. Iyyapan V/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and another, 2013 ACJ 1944 wherein it is held as under:
Scch - 11 11 MVC No.1536/2014 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, section 149 (2) (a) (ii)- Motor insurance-Driving licence-Liability of insurance company-Driver had licence to drive light motor vehicle, he was driving maxicab which is a light motor vehicle but it was being used as a commercial vehicle-Whether insurance company can disown its liability on the ground that driver although duly licensed to drive light motor vehicle but there was no endorsement in the licence to drive light motor vehicle used as commercial vehicle- Held; no; insurance company may proceed against insured for recovery of amount if there is any violation of condition of insurance policy.
In one more decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Kulwant Singh and others V/s Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., 2014 ACJ 2873, wherein it is held as under:

Insurance company disputes its liability on the Scch - 11 12 MVC No.1536/2014 ground that driver had licence to drive light motor vehicle but he was driving a goods vehicle-
Tribunal mulcted liability on the insurance company on the ground that offending vehicle was 'light goods vehicle' and driver had a valid and effective driving licence-High Court observed that 'light motor vehicle' cannot be equated with 'light goods vehicle', there was breach of policy as driver did no have valid and effective driving licence and granted recovery rights to insurance company-Whether a person holding driving licence to drive 'light motor vehicle' was authorised to drive 'light goods vehicle' and there was no breach of Insurance policy-Held; yes; order of High Court set aside and Tribunal's order restored. (2013 ACJ 1944 (SC) and 2008 ACJ 721 (SC) followed).

We find the judgments relied upon cover the issue in favour of the appellants. In Annappa Irappa Nesaria, 2008 ACJ 721 (SC), this court Scch - 11 13 MVC No.1536/2014 referred to the provisions of section 2 (21) and (23) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which are definitions of 'light motor vehicle' and 'medium goods vehicle' respectively and the rules prescribing the forms for the licence, i.e., rule 14 and Form No.4. It was concluded:
"(16) From what has been noticed hereinbefore, it is evident that 'transport vehicle' has now been substituted for 'medium goods vehicle' and 'heavy goods vehicle'. The light motor vehicle continued, at the relevant point of time, to cover both 'light passenger carriage vehicle' and 'light goods carriage vehicle'. A driver who had a valid and effective driving licence to drive a light motor vehicle, therefore, was authorised to drive a light goods vehicle as well."
In S. Iyyapan, 2013 ACJ 1944 (SC), the question was whether the driver who had a licence to drive 'light motor vehicle' could drive 'light motor vehicle' used as a commercial Scch - 11 14 MVC No.1536/2014 vehicle, without obtaining endorsement to drive a commercial vehicle. It was held that in such a case, the insurance company could not disown its liability. It was observed:
"(19) In the instant case, admittedly the driver was holding a valid driving licence to drive light motor vehicle. There is no dispute that the motor vehicle in question, by which accident took place, was Mahindra maxicab. Merely because the driver did not get any endorsement in the driving licence to driver Mahindra maxicab, which is a light motor vehicle, the High Court has committed grave error of law in holding that insurer is not liable to pay compensation because the driver was not holding the licence to drive a commercial vehicle. The impugned judgment is, therefore, liable to be set aside." In another decision of Hon'ble High Court reported in Kempegowda and another V/s Seena and another, 2014 ACJ 381, wherein it is held as under:
Scch - 11 15 MVC No.1536/2014 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, section 149 (2) (a)
(ii)-Motor insurance-Driving licence-Liability of insurance company-Insurance company disputes its liability on the ground that driver was holding a licence to drive light motor vehicle but he was driving a Tempo which is a transport/goods vehicle-Insurance company adduced no material to substantiate its contention-Tribunal on the basis of evidence held that driver had valid and effective driving licence to drive the particular type of vehicle and no policy conditions are violated by the owner-insured-Whether insurance company is liable-Held; yes. (Para 9) In a decision of Hon'ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, reported in Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. V/s Mahesh Kumar and others, 2011 ACJ 1606, wherein it is held as under:

[(2007-1) 145 PR 528 and AIR 1971 SC 1865 relied.] In one more decision of Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Indore Bench in Nathulal V/s Kachrulal and others, 2014 ACJ 263, wherein it is held as under:

In a decision of Hon'ble High Court reported in Shivarama Parameshwara Hegde V/s Subray Honnappa Naik and another, 2011 ACJ 1464, it is held that, Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, section 149 (2)
(a) (ii)- Motor insurance-Driving licence-Liability of insurance company-Insurance company disputes its liability on the ground that driver had no valid licence to drive goods vehicle on the date of Scch - 11 18 MVC No.1536/2014 accident-Driver had licence valid from 28.1.2000 to 27.1.2020 with further endorsement permitting him to drive transport vehicle for the period up to 5.1.2014-Contention that licence to drive transport vehicles is issued for three years and thus 6.1.2001 should be taken as the date to reckon the validity of licence to drive transport vehicle and the accident occurred prior to that date, viz., 31.12.2000-Insurance company produced photocopy of licence for placing reliance on it, it is bound by it and it failed to examine any official from the Motor Vehicles Department to elicit as to whether such an issuance of licence is legally permissible or not-Whether the insurance company could establish that driver had no valid and effective driving licence to drive goods vehicle which he was driving at the time of accident and is exempted from liability-Held: no.

13) Though RW.1 has stated in his evidence that, the driver of the said vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence, insurance Scch - 11 19 MVC No.1536/2014 company has not examined RTO authority to establish that the driver was not holding valid and effective driving licence to drive the goods vehicle. Even in the decision reported in 2014 ACJ 381, Hon'ble High Court has held that, Insurance company fails to adduce any materials to substantiate its contention. Even in the decision reported in 2014 ACJ 2873, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the person holding driving licence to drive the light Motor vehicle was authorized to drive the light goods vehicle and there was no breach of insurance policy. Even in the said judgment, Hon'ble Supreme Court referred the decision of National Insurance Co. Ltd. V/s Annappa Irappa Nesaria, 2008 ACJ 721 (SC) wherein it is held as under:

"(19) In the instant case, admittedly the driver was holding a valid driving licence to drive light motor vehicle. There is no dispute that the motor vehicle in question, by which accident took place, was Scch - 11 21 MVC No.1536/2014 Mahindra maxicab. Merely because the driver did not get any endorsement in the driving licence to driver Mahindra maxicab, which is a light motor vehicle, the High Court has committed grave error of law in holding that insurer is not liable to pay compensation because the driver was not holding the licence to drive a commercial vehicle. The impugned judgment is, therefore, liable to be set aside."
Even in the decision of Hon'ble High Court reported in 2011 ACJ 1464 and decision of Hon'ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana reported in 2011 ACJ 1606, it is held that the insurance company has to examine witness from licence authority to prove that the driver was not holding valid licence and burden is upon the insurance policy. But in this case also, only authorized officer of insurance company has been examined and licensing authority has not been examined and the burden regarding not possessing valid and effective driving licence is not discharged by the insurance company. So, the contention taken by the respondent No.2 is not acceptable. So, I answered issue No.2 in Negative.
Scch - 11 22 MVC No.1536/2014
14) Issue No.3 : The respondent No.2 taken contention that, this petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary party. But this contention of the respondent No.2 is not acceptable. Because, the vehicle involved in the accident is Tata Sumo bearing No.KA-05-AA-4848 and there is no involvement of any other vehicle in the accident and petitioner has rightly impleaded owner and insurer of the Tata Sumo vehicle and there is no other vehicle involved in the accident, question of impleading owner and insurer of other vehicles does not arise at all. So, this contention of the respondent No.2 is not at all acceptable. So, I answer issue No.3 in Negative.

15) Issue No.4 : PW.1 has stated in his evidence that, he sustained grievous injuries and after the accident, he was shifted to R.L. Jalappa Hospital wherein first aid treatment was given and afterwards, he was shifted to K.R. Puram Super Speciality hospital, and afterwards, he was referred to Manipal hospital, wherein he was admitted as an inpatient from 27.01.2014 to 11.02.2014. The petitioner has produced medical bills of Rs.2,28,459/- and said documents are marked as Ex.P.15 and he has also produced medical prescriptions, which are marked as Ex.P.16. The petitioner has taken treatment in Manipal hospital and K.R. Puram Super Speciality Hospital and he has also produced advanced receipt of K.R.
Scch - 11 23 MVC No.1536/2014 Puram Super Speciality Hospital and Manipal Hospital, which are marked as Ex.P.18 to 23. The petitioner has spent Rs.2,28,459/- towards medical treatment. The learned counsel for respondent No.2 taken contention that, the medical bills are paid through cheques and reimbursed. The said contention is not acceptable. Because, there is no entry about availment of any medical facility by the petitioner and no cheque numbers are mentioned in Ex.P.15 and the said amount has been paid by way of cash or using credit card and for that reasons, it has been shown in the online payment in the medical bills. So, petitioner is entitled for compensation of Rs.2,28,459/- under the head of Medical Expenses. Hence, petitioner is awarded compensation of Rs.2,28,459/-/- under the head of Medical Expenses.

16) The petitioner sustained pelvic injury. The petitioner was admitted in the K.R Puram Super Speciality hospital for two days and he was shifted to the Manipal Hospital, Bangalore and admitted as an inpatient from 27.01.2014 to 11.02.2014 and he was admitted in both the hospitals for total period of 16 days. During the period of hospitalization, petitioner would have spent some amount towards food, conveyance, nourishment and attendant charges. Considering the cost of living and also the cost of medical expenses and period of treatment, I feel it just and Scch - 11 24 MVC No.1536/2014 proper to award the compensation of Rs.20,000/- under the head of food, conveyance, nourishment and attendant charges. Hence, petitioner is awarded compensation of Rs.20,000/- under the head of food, conveyance, nourishment and attendant charges.
17) The petitioner was admitted in the hospital for the period of 16 days and during the period of hospitalization, he has lost his income and after discharge from the hospital, he would have taken bed rest and even the doctors have advised wheel chair mobilized. This goes to show that, the petitioner is unable to walk due to the accidental injuries and after discharge from the hospital, he has lost some income and he was totally admitted for 16 days in the hospital. Considering the period of hospitalization and bed rest advised to the petitioner, I feel it just and proper to award the compensation of Rs.20,000/- under the head of loss of income during the laid up period. Hence, petitioner is awarded compensation of Rs.20,000/- under the head of loss of income during laid up period.

18) PW.1 has produced wound certificate and as per the said document, petitioner suffered head injury with sub-arachnoidhemorrhage, Scch - 11 25 MVC No.1536/2014 blunt injury abdomen with splenic laceration and closed pelvic fracture, left sacral pole and bilateral public rami fracture and he has taken conservative treatment. The doctors of Manipal hospital advised wheel chair mobilized. Even on perusal of the cross-examination of PW.2, there is no suggestion to the doctor about present condition of the petitioner. Due to the accidental injuries, the petitioner would not be in a position to enjoy the amenities in life as earlier and he suffered physically and mentally and he has to depend upon others for his daily activities. Because, the doctors advised to use wheel chair mobilized and it requires the service of attendant for every moment, by which the petitioner has lost some amenities in life. Considering the gravity of the injury and also the medical advice given by the doctors, I feel it just and proper to award the compensation of Rs.25,000/- under head of loss of amenities in life. So, I hold that petitioner is not entitled for compensation of Rs.25,000/- under the head of loss of amenities in life.

19) Due to the accidental injuries, petitioner has to undergo deep pain and agony and there are no materials about healing of injuries. So, considering the nature of injuries, I feel it just and proper to award the compensation of Rs.20,000/- under the head of pain and agony. Hence, Scch - 11 26 MVC No.1536/2014 petitioner is awarded compensation of Rs.20,000/- under the head of Pain and agony.

20) As per the wound certificate, petitioner sustained contusion over abdomen and wound fracture and except injury No.2, injury No.1 and 3 are grievous in nature. The learned counsel for petitioner contented that the petitioner was shifted to R.L. Jalappa hospital and then he was shifted to K.R. Puram Super Specialty hospital and afterwards he was shifted to Manipal hospital. He was also submitted that, except abrasion, other injuries are grievous in nature and POP cost applied and petitioner has sustained whole body disability at 18% and doctor was not given head injury disability. He was getting salary of Rs.10,000/- and he is completely bedridden. The learned counsel for respondent contended in his argument that as per the wound certificate, the petitioner sustained simple injuries and as per the evidence of PW.2, petitioner has sustained whole body disability at 18% and there are no documents about follow-up treatment and petitioner was admitted in the hospital for one day and discharged on next day. He has also submitted that, the pelvic injury is not grievous in nature and disability cannot be given to the said injury. In the cross-examination of PW.1, he has admitted that, he has not produced study certificate to show that, he was aged about 19 years as on the date Scch - 11 27 MVC No.1536/2014 of accident. He has also admitted that he has not produced any documents to show that he was working as cleaner. In the cross- examination of PW.2, he has not issued disability certificate and he has not seen the previous records at the time of examination. He has also submitted that, petitioner has taken conservative treatment. He has denied the suggestion of the learned counsel for respondent that, disability cannot be assessed to the pelvic fracture. Since PW.2 admitted in his cross-examination that the petitioner has taken only conservative treatment the disability assessed by the PW.2 on higher side. So, I feel it just and proper to consider disability at 15%. The petitioner has not produced any documents about his age and avocation and his income. In the medical records, the age of the petitioner is show as 18 years and in the medical records of K.R. Puram Super Specialty Hospital, the age of the petitioner is show as 21 years. If the age of the petitioner is taken in between 15 to 20, the multiplier applicable to the facts of the case is 18. If the notional income of petitioner is taken at Rs.5,000/-, there shall be addition of 50% as per the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Rajesh and others V/s Rajbir Singh and others. Then the monthly income will be Rs.7,500/-. If 1/3 is deducted towards persons expenses, net income will be Rs.5,000/-. Then loss of income will be Scch - 11 28 MVC No.1536/2014 Rs.5,000/-x12x18x15/100 = 1,62,000/-.
So, I hold that petitioner is entitled for compensation of Rs.1,62,000/-. Hence petitioner is awarded compensation of Rs.1,62,000/- under the head of loss of income.

21) The petitioner has produced Ex.P.9 and as per the said document, the doctor of Manipal hospital issued estimation of Rs.2,80,000/- and it has been re-estimated to Rs.3,20,000/- in view of present position for reference to the other and extended stage has planned earlier. But the said estimation is hypothecal and not based upon nature of injuries and treatment. Because in Ex.P.9, it is not clear that for which purpose the petitioner is to be referred to other facilities and for which purpose he has to stay. Because in the x-rays, there are no implants and petitioner need not undergo any surgery for removal of implants. Even the PW.2 has also not advised any future treatment. But the hospital authorities of Manipal Hospital hypothecally shown cost of estimate which is not at all believable. So, I hold that the estimate issued by the hospital authorities is highly improbable and not believable. However, considering the nature of treatment, I feel it just and proper to award the compensation of Rs.10,000/- under the head of future medical Scch - 11 29 MVC No.1536/2014 expenses, which shall not carry any interest. Hence, I hold that petitioner is entitled for compensation of Rs.10,000/- under the said head.
22) The Calculation table stands as follows:

So, I hold that petitioner is entitled for compensation of Rs.4,85,459/- along with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of claim petition till its realization.

Respondent No.1 is owner of the offending vehicle and respondent No.2 is insurer of the said vehicle and as per Ex.R.1, the insurance policy Scch - 11 30 MVC No.1536/2014 was in force as on the date of accident. So, the respondent No.2 is liable to indemnify the respondent No.1. So I hold that petitioner is entitled for compensation of Rs.4,85,459/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of petition from respondent No.2, till complete realization. Accordingly, I answer this issue No.2 partly affirmative.
23) ISSUE No.3: In view of answers to issues No.1 & 2, I proceeding to pass the following:


shall be deposited in F.D in the name of petitioner in any nationalized or scheduled bank for the period of 5 years Scch - 11 31 MVC No.1536/2014 and petitioner is at liberty to withdraw the accrued interest on the said deposit amount, failing to furnish the particulars, the same shall be deposited in Karnataka Bank, City Civil Court Branch, Bangalore Remaining amount of Rs.3,85,459/- along with accrued interest shall be released to the petitioner through account payee crossed cheque, on proper identification and verification.
Advocate fee is fixed at Rs.1,000/-.
Draw award accordingly.
