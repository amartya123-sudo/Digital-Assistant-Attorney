Calcutta High Court
Sk. Nizamuddin vs The State Of West Bengal & Ors on 7 December, 2010
Author: Indira Banerjee
Before The Hon'ble Justice INDIRA BANERJEE 07.12.2010 The petitioner has been granted a permanent stage carriage permit being P.st.p. No.30/2005 by the State Transport Authority, West Bengal to operate a vehicle in the route Chittaranjan to Garer Ghat, as specified in paragraph 2 of the writ petition.
The respondent No.6 has been issued a permanent stage carriage permit by the Regional Transport Authority, Burdwan, to operate a vehicle on the route from Barakar to Burdwan via Asansol and Ranigunge. It is submitted that a part of the route covered by the petitioner, that is, part of the route from Asansol to Durgapur overlaps with part of the route on which the respondent No.6 operates.

Under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is a condition of all stage carriage permits, that vehicles should be operated as per the timetable issued by the transport authority and the timetable should be kept on display in a prominent part of the vehicle.
According to the petitioner, the permit issued to the petitioner is valid till March, 2015. The respondent No.6 was issued a timetable vide Memo No.4855/MV dated 8th November, 2006. For about 4 years, the respondent No.6 plied his vehicle as per the aforesaid timetable and there was no dispute between the petitioner and the respondent No.6.
The petitioner has alleged that by a Memo No.4136/1 (7/NV) dated 22nd October, 2010, the timetable of the respondent No.6 has been revised in such a way that the arrival and departure timings of the vehicles of the petitioner and the respondent No.6 to and from bus stops between Burdwan and Asansol clash.

Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the timetable was a condition of permit. Once a timetable was fixed at the time of grant of permit or renewal thereof, that timetable could not be changed by the transport authority for as long as the permit remained valid. If the timetable were to be altered, the requisites for alteration of conditions of permit stipulated in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 would have to be complied with.
Counsel submitted that the Regional Transport Authority was not competent to alter the time schedule of the respondent No.6 for operation of vehicles. If the Regional Transport Authority was not competent to alter the timings the Chairman as delegate of the Regional Transport Authority could also not alter the timings.

Counsel cited the judgment of the Division Bench of Patna High Court in M/s. Rajput Transport Company vs. Nand Kishore Prasad & Ors. reported in AIR 1973 Pat. 373. The Judgment in M/s. Rajput Transport Co. (supra) was rendered in the context of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, which has been repealed and replaced by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
Under the scheme of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and in particular Section 88 thereof, it is a condition of every permit that the vehicle shall be plied as per the timetable issued by the transport authority concerned and the timetable shall be kept on display in the vehicle. The timetable itself is not a condition of the permit. Since timetable itself is not a condition of the permit, the requisites stipulated in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for alteration of timetable are not necessary. In any case, the petitioner has no locus standi to question the alteration of timetable of the respondent No.6.

There can, however, be no doubt that the State Transport Authority and/or the Regional Transport Authority concerned should fix the timetable in a fair and reasonable manner taking into consideration all relevant factors, including the convenience of the operators, but giving utmost importance to the requirements of the travelling public.
The timetable might be changed from time to time. In fact change of timetable and rotation of timings may be necessary for equal treatment of operators operating on any particular route and/or area.

As rightly argued by counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, the speed limit should never be crossed. There can, therefore, be no doubt that timetables would have to be fixed in such a manner that vehicles are not required to cross the speed limit. It is also desirable that timetables should be fixed after giving operators on the route opportunity of representation. However, the decision must be that of the transport authority. Timetables cannot be fixed at the dictates of any person, group of persons or association.
It is not for the Writ Court exercising its extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to embark upon investigation into facts and adjudicate whether timings for operation of vehicles have properly been fixed.
The timetable has to be fixed by the transport authority concerned taking into account all relevant factors, including the convenience of the commuters and to the extent feasible, the convenience of the operators of vehicles. Under the liberalized policy of grant of permits, under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, many routes are overcrowded and some clash of timings may be inevitable. Disputes with regard to timetables have to be resolved by the transport authorities concerned.

In this case the State Transport Authority, West Bengal has issued a timetable to the petitioner, whereas the Regional Transport Authority, Burdwan has issued a timetable to the respondent No.6. The petitioner has no cause of action against the State Transport Authority, West Bengal. The petitioner is not competent to question the timetable issued by the Regional Transport Authority to the respondent No.6.

It is for the concerned transport authorities to ensure smooth operation of vehicles even on routes which overlap. If the timings fixed by the transport authorities impede smooth operation, the concerned transport authorities would have to resolve the matter in consultation with each other.

If the petitioner makes a representation to the State Transport Authority, West Bengal and the State Transport Authority is satisfied that the grievances of the petitioner are genuine, the State Transport Authority may take up the matter with the concerned Regional Transport Authority/Authorities and the respective authorities might in consultation with each other fix the timings of transport vehicles in a fair and equitable manner.
The writ application is disposed of with the above observation/direction. Urgent certified copy of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the parties upon compliance with all requisite formalities.
