Both the prosecution witnesses have clearly deposed that the accused was carrying 13 passengers inside the vehicle and was driving the same waivingly in a very dangerous fashion. Carrying excess passengers than the permissible limit of a vehicle itself makes it dangerous to drive the vehicle on road and further driving it waivingly in a zig\\xadzag manner further increases the possibility of accidents on the road and in such a case the passengers may fell from the vehicle. Therefore, the allegation of dangerous driving also stands proved against the accused driver. Similarly, the allegation of violation of condition of registration certificate also stands proved as both the prosecution witnesses categorically deposed that the offending vehicle was carrying 13 passengers inside it which is beyond its permissible limit of six passengers.\\nFurther, the allegation that the accused driver was without uniform also stands proved as both the prosecution witnesses have clearly deposed that the accused driver was found without uniform at the time of violation.\\nIn the end, Ld. APP for the State has submitted that since the prosecution has proved all the allegations against the accused, therefore, he must be convicted for the same.\\n\\n9. After all the discussion above, the court finds merits in the submission of Ld. APP for the State. All the allegations levelled against the accused stands proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The route permit allotted in favour of permit holder itself makes it clear that it does not covers the area of place of offence. The allegation of violation of registration certificate, dangerous driving and without uniform also stands proved in view of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses Vehicle No. : DL\\xad2W\\xad5108 19 of 20 as the same has remained intact and consistent throughout the trial. The court finds merit in the argument of Ld. APP for the State that there is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of prosecution witnesses particularly when there is no allegation of ill\\xadmotive or falsehood against any of the prosecution witnesses. The same view has also been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sanspal Singh Vs. State of Delhi, 1999, Cr.L.J 1a. Accordingly, the accused stands convicted for all the charges levelled against him as prosecution has proved the same beyond all reasonable doubts.\\nLet the accused driver be heard separately on quantum of sentence.

Therefore, this ground of revision that the petitioner was not aware about the consequences of pleading guilty is not acceptable at all. In my view, the Ld. Trial Court has rightly observed that as the accused was driving the vehicle after taking huge amount of alcohol, without having driving license, without insurance, without helmet and without pollution certificate, only the punishment of fine would not have a deterrent or reformative effect on the convict. In my view, sentence for four days of simple imprisonment is not harsh in such circumstances. Also, as the Ld.
